#= According to Brad DeLong in lectures 1 & 2, Econ 207 UCB, the six most important macroeconomic variables are

1. Real GDP, GDPC1 (Q), the broadest measure of economic activity
2. The unemployment rate, UNRATE (M),a measure of slack and waste.
3. Inflation rate and price level, CPIAUCSL (M), a measure of how well the economy enables rational economic decisions
4. Stock market indices, business and investor confidence. Shiller will be the best source for this.
5. Interest rates on short term gov't bonds, TB3MS (M), a measure of liquidity in the economy
6. Interest rates on long term corporate bonds, a measure of business access to capital. Shiller is also the best source for this.
