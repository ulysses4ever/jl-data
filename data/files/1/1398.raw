A simple species uses only a single representation, and defaults to using
scalar fitness if no fitness scheme is specified. For most problems, simple
species will suffice.

The genome of an individual belonging to a simple species may be retrieved
through its `genome` property.

**Properties:**

* `representation::Representation`, the solution represented used by members
of this species.
* `fitness::FitnessScheme`, the fitness scheme used by members of this
species. Defaults to (maximised) scalar fitness if unspecified.
