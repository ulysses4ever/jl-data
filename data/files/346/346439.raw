# Assignment 1: Iterating and Memory
# Note: you don't really want to run this file directly
# Instead, use it to inform what commands you type into the Julia prompt

# 1. Open Julia
# Record memory usage here:

# 2. Load trips.csv all at once
# Use the readlines command we used before
# Record memory usage here:

# 3. Use a for loop to calculate the average duration of trips
# We can modify the code we had for stations to do this
# Think about how we can calculate an average on-the-fly - what
# is the definition of sample average? What do we need to
# accumulate as we go?
# Record memory usage here:

# 4. Close Julia, open it again
# Record memory usage here:

# 5. Use eachline...
# If you are up to here, you don't need a hint!
