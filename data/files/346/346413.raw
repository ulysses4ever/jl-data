# Hubway charges a variable amount for a bike ride, depending on the duration
# of the ride. They have the following rates for casual users:
# [0, 30) minutes -- $0
# [30, 60) minutes -- $2
# [60, 420) minutes -- $[8*floor(minutes/30)-10]
# 420+ minutes -- $100
# The rate for registered users is 75% that of casual users (e.g. registered
# users has a max fee of $75). The fee depends on both the duration of the
# trip and the registration_status of the trip.
# We want to find, between each pair of stations, the average charge and
# the standard deviation of the charges, as well as number of trips in the
# dataset. The final output should a be file in the format:
# start_station, end_station, count, avg_charge, stddev_charge

# MAP
# Design the map function before coding.
# 1. What information do you need from the string?
# 2. Which fields is this located in?
# 3. One you've extracted them, you need to calculate the fare
#    (you can put the fair calculation in a seperate function to keep your
#     code clean, and that way you can test your fare calculation code
#     seperately from your MapReduce.)
# You should look at "mapreduce_script.jl" for inspiration!
