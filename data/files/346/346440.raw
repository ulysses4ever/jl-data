# Assignment 1: Iterating and Memory
# Note: you don't really want to run this file directly
# Instead, use it to inform what commands you type into the Julia prompt

# 1. Open Julia
# Record memory usage here:

# 2. Load trips.csv all at once
# Use the readlines command we used before.
# Record memory usage here:

# 3. Close Julia, open it again
# Record memory usage here:

# 4. Use eachline with a for loop to calculate the average duration of trips.
# We can modify the code we had for stations to do this.
# Think about how we can calculate an average on-the-fly - what is the
# definition of sample average?
# Hint: duration is the second field of the trips.csv dataset
