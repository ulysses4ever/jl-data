# Assignment 2
# Write a program in Julia (or whatever) that
# 1. Takes trips.csv and extracts the start_station and end_station for 
#    all trips with a duration between 60 and 3600, and saves them to
#    reduced.csv as you go
# 2. Load reduced.csv line-by-line and determine which pair of stations
#    had the fewest trips and most trips.
# Hints: not all station IDs are used. Maybe record a list of station
# ids as you load reduced.csv? You can store the matrix of start-end trips
# in a matrix or dictionary-of-dictionaries (extra: can you be even smarter?)

# Part 1

  # Sometimes we can't turn the station into an int
  # Because its NA. One way to handle this is to
  # try it, and if it causes an error, catch the error
  # and keep on going
