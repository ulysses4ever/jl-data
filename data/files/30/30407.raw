    juldate(date::DateTime) -> Float64

Takes the given `DateTime` and returns the number of Julian calendar days since
epoch `1858-11-16T12:00:00` (Reduced Julian Date = Julian Date - 2400000) as a
`Float64`.

**NOTE:** Before `1582-10-15T00:00:00` the date is assumed to be in Julian
Calendar, thus before this date `juldate` is *not* the inverse of `daycnv`.  For
the conversion of Gregorian date to number of Julian days, use `jdcnv`, which is
the inverse of `daycnv`.
"""
# Before 1582-10-15 Dates.datetime2julian uses proleptic Gregorian Calendar,
# instead AstroLib's juldate uses Julian Calendar.  In addition, after that day
# using Dates.datetime2julian(date)-2.4e6 would give results not precise enough.
# For all these reasons, we use here the same algorithm as AstroLib's juldate.
