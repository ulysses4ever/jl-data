# a one line header: <num_vertices>, <num_edges>, {"d" | "u"}, <name>
#   - num_vertices is an integer
#   - num_edges is an integer
#   - "d" for directed graph, "u" for undirected. Note that this
#       option does not perform any additional edge construction; it's
#       merely used to return the correct type of graph.
#   - name is a string
# header followed by a list of (comma-delimited) edges - src,dst.
# Multiple graphs may be present in one file.
