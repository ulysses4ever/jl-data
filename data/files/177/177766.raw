Randomized matrix norm estimator

Computes a probabilistic upper bound on the norm of a matrix `A`.

\cite[Lemma 4.1]{Halko2011} states (with slight notational change) that

‖A‖ ≤ α √(2/π) maxᵢ ‖Aωᵢ‖

with probability $$p=α^{-r}$$.

Inputs:
    `A`: Matrix whose norm to estimate
    `r`: Number of matrix-vector products to compute
    `p`: Probability of upper bound failing (default: 0.05)

Output:
    Estimate of ‖A‖.

    premultiplying by both `A` and `A'`

Randomized matrix norm estimator using `A'A`

Computes a probabilistic upper bound on the norm of a matrix `A`.

\cite[Appendix]{Liberty2007} states (with minor change in notation) that 

ρ = √(‖(A'A)ʲω‖/‖(A'A)ʲ⁻¹ω‖)

which is an estimate of the spectral norm of A produced by j
steps of the power method starting with normalized ω, is a lower
bound on the true norm by a factor

ρ ≤ α ‖A‖

with probability greater than $$1 - p$$, where
$$p = 4\sqrt{n/(j-1)} α^{-2j}$$.

Inputs:
    `A`: Matrix whose norm to estimate
    `j`: Number of power iterations to perform. (Default: 1)
    `p`: Probability of upper bound failing. (Default: 0.05)
    `At` (optional keyword): Transpose of `A`. (Default: `A'`)

Output:
    Estimate of ‖A‖.

Randomized condition number estimator

Inputs:
    `A`: Matrix whose condition number to estimate.
         Must be square and support premultiply (`A*⋅`) and solve (`A\⋅`)
    `k`: Number of power iterations to run. (Default: 1, recommended: `k ≤ 3`)
    `p`: Probability that estimate fails to hold as an upper bound
       (Default: 0.05)

Output:

    The interval `(x, y)` which contains `κ(A)` with probability $$1 - p$$.

Implementation note:

    \cite{Dixon1983} originally describes this as a computation that
    can be done by computing the necessary number of power iterations given p
    and the desired accuracy parameter θ=y/x. However, these bounds were only
    derived under the assumptions of exact arithmetic. Empirically, k≥4 has
    been seen to result in incorrect results in that the computed interval does
    not contain the true condition number. This implemention therefore makes `k`
    an explicitly user-controllable parameter from which to infer the accuracy
    parameter and hence the interval containing κ(A).
