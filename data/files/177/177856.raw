"""
    rsvdfact(A, n, p=0)

Compute partial singular value decomposition of `A` using a randomized
algorithm.

# Arguments

`A`: input matrix.

`n::Int`: number of singular value/vector pairs to find.

`p::Int=0`: number of extra vectors to include in computation.

# Output

`::SVD`: singular value decomposition.

# Warning

This variant of the randomized singular value decomposition is the most
commonly found implementation but is not recommended for accurate
computations, as it often has trouble finding the `n` largest singular pairs,
but rather finds `n` large singular pairs which may not necessarily be the
largest.

# Implementation note

This function calls `rrange`, which uses naive randomized rangefinding to
compute a basis for a subspace of dimension `n` (Algorithm 4.1 of
\cite{Halko2011}), followed by `svdfact_restricted()`, which computes the
exact SVD factorization on the restriction of `A` to this randomly selected
subspace (Algorithm 5.1 of \cite{Halko2011}).

Alternatively, you can mix and match your own randomized algorithm using
any of the randomized range finding algorithms to find a suitable subspace
and feeding the result to one of the routines that computes the `SVD`
restricted to that subspace.
