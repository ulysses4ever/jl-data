Test two `DataNode`s for equality. This "loose" form of `DataNode` equality is
satisfied when both `dn1` and `dn2` are empty, as in the case of a base
`DataNode` of a `Query` graph that has not yet been `collect`ed against.

    Base.isequal{T<:QueryNode}(q1::T, q2::T)::Bool

Test two `QueryNode` objects for equality.

Note that the result depends only on the `input` and `args` fields of each
`q1` and `q2`; the contents of the `helpers` and `parameters` fields are not
compared. This "loose" form of `QueryNode` equality is therefore only
determined by the content of the expression passed to `@query` and reflects the
expectation that the same query (as passed to `@query`) twice should produce
`Query` objects that satisfy `isequal`.
