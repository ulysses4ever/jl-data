# A device model is a function that returns a list of equations or
# other devices that also return lists of equations. The equations
# each are assumed equal to zero. So,
#    der(y) = x + 1
# Should be entered as:
#    der(y) - (x+1)
#
# The Van Der Pol oscillator is a simple problem with two equations
# and two unknowns:

function Vanderpol()
    y = Unknown(1.0, "y")   # The 1.0 is the initial value. "y" is for plotting.
    x = Unknown("x")        # The initial value is zero if not given.
    # The following gives the return value which is a list of equations.
    # Expressions with Unknowns are kept as expressions. Expressions of
    # regular variables are evaluated immediately (like normal).
    {
     # The -1.0 in der(x, -1.0) is the initial value for the derivative 
     der(x, -1.0) - ((1 - y^2) * x - y) # == 0 is assumed
     der(y) - x
     }
end

v = Vanderpol()       # returns the hierarchical model
v_f = elaborate(v)    # returns the flattened model
v_s = create_sim(v_f) # returns a "Sim" ready for simulation

v_yout = sim(v_s, 10.0) # run the simulation to 10 seconds and return
                        # the result as an array

# Plotting requires the Gaston library, and I need to load it:
#   push(LOAD_PATH, "/home/tshort/julia/julia/extras/gaston-0.4")
#   load("gaston.jl")
## plot(v_yout)

# # plot the signals against each other:
# plot(v_yout.y[:,2], v_yout.y[:,3])
