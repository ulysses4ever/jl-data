# Adjaceny Matrix

"""
`adjacency(G)` returns the adjacency matrix of `G`.

Note: If the vertices can be sorted by `sort`, then the first row of
the adjacency matrix correspons to the first vertex (in order) in `G`
and so forth. However, if the vertices are not sortable in this way,
the mapping between vertices and rows/columns of the matrix is
unpredictable.

`laplace(G)` returns the Laplacian matrix of `G`. This is the
adjacency matrix minus the (diagonal) degree matrix. See `adjacency`
to understand how vertices correspond to rows/columns of the resulting
matrix.

"""

`incidence(G)` returns the vertex-edge incidence matrix of `G`.

Notes:

* The result is a sparse matrix. Wrap in `full` to convert to nonsparse.

* Each column of the matrix has exactly one `+1` and one `-1`. If `G`
is undirected and an unsigned incidence matrix is desired, use
`incidence(G,false)`.
