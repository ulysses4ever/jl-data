module DeepReshapes

export describe, deep_length, deep_reshape, flatten, pack

# describe(x) recursively describes the dimensions of x
#   1. so that some deep reshapes can be reversed and
#   2. to determine the number of scalar values contained within (from
#      deep_length()).
#
# At the moment, the only recognized scalars are Numbers.
#
# In the untyped version (typed = false) this is a generalization of
# Base.size(): the specification of
#   - a scalar is an empty tuple,
#   - an Array of scalars is the Tuple of its dimensions,
#   - any other Array is the Array{Any} of specifications of its elements,
#   - a non-empty Tuple is the Tuple of specification of its elements,
#   - anything else is not defined.
#
# When typed = true, the specification of
#   - a scalar is its type,
#   - an Array of scalars is the Tuple of its element type concatenated with its
#     dimensions,
#   - and of all other objects is the same as in the untyped case.

  # ^ We use map! here because we want to define the element type of the result.


# A deep_reshape(x, specification) iterates over all the scalars (recursively)
# contained within x, and from that stream writes into a new object whose
# structure is defined by specification.
#
# This happens in two independent processes which are executed in parallel:
#   - deep_produce() recursively walks the input and produces the scalars, and
#   - consume_structured() recursively builds the result from them according to
#     specification.
#
# By default, deep_produce() descends into Arrays and Tuples, but that behavior
# can be overridden by supplying the optional Deep argument. All encountered
# values that are not of Deep type are considered scalar by deep_produce() and
# therefore produced directly.
#
# The specification is of the same format that describe() returns.
