# structure() recursively describes a deep-reshapable object
#   1. so that reshapes can be reversed and
#   2. to determine the number of Scalar values contained within in the
#      deep_length() function.
#
# In the untyped version (typed = false) this is a generalization of
# Base.size(): the structure of
#   - a Scalar is an empty tuple,
#   - an Array of Scalars is the Tuple of dimensions,
#   - an Array of non-Scalars is the Array{Any} of structures of its elements,
#   - a non-empty Tuple is the Tuple of structures of its elements,
#   - an empty Tuple is nothing.
#
# When typed = true, the structure of
#   - a Scalar is its type,
#   - an Array of Scalars is the Tuple of its element type concatenated with its
#     dimensions,
#   - and of all other objects is the same as in the untyped case.

# A deep_reshape(x, structure) iterates over all the Scalars (recursively)
# contained within x, and copies them into a now object whose structure is
# defined in the same format that structure() returns.
#
# This happens in two independent processes which are executed in parallel:
#   - produce_scalars() recursively walks the input and yields the scalars, and
#   - consume_stucture() recursively builds the result structure from them.
