# Visual representation of the World module with Tk and Cairo. It creates
# a platform independent window with organisms (one point - one organism)
# and tracks them in real time. So, it's just a perresentation of organism's
# moves in the World. We have to use separate module to have an ability to
# change the output. For example, it's possible to show organisms like a 
# circles in OpenGL canvas.
