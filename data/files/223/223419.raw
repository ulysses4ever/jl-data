# Problem 6
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
#   1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
#   (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
# numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
# natural numbers and the square of the sum.

square(n) = n * n

nums = [ 1:100 ]
difference = square(sum(nums)) - sum(map(square, nums))

println(difference)
# 25164150
