function vblast{T}(H::Array{T},mu=Inf)
# [W P B] = vblast(H)
#  Returns a VBLAST matrix decomposition of H such that 
#  H = pinv(W)*B*P' or B = W*H*P.  Here P is a permutation matrix, B is
#  lower triangular with ones on the diagonal, and W has orthogonal rows.
# [W P B] = vblast(H,mu)
#  If an SNR argument mu is passed in, a regularized ("MMSE")
#  decomposition is done, with the result that W will no longer have
#  orthogonal rows and B is no longer lower triangular.
#
# Example: For decoding with N receivers
#  N=4;H = rand(N,N); include("vblast.jl");(W,P,B) = vblast(H)
# Example: For MMSE decoding with N receivers mu=rho/N 
#  (W,P,B) = vblast(H,rho/size(H,1));
