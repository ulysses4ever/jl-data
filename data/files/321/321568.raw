    Shell(center::Position, lqn::LQuantumNumber, exponents::[Float], coefficients::[Float64]; renorm=true)
A shell of basis functions is the collection of basis functions that share a center and radial definition (e.g. 
the px, py and pz orbital that are defined together by their center, exponents and coefficients. Contrary to other codes we also consider a shell to have a unique LQuantumNumber not allowing for shared-sp tricks. Working with shells
instead of the individual basis functions allows for some performance gains in integral evaluation.
If renorm is set to false, then the coefficients are read in "as is". With renorm set to true the coefficients are expected to be given as with a basis set file and normalized accordingly. This is the default in accordance with LibInt2Shell, where this is necessary due to performance reasons. (As such the normalization scaling is taken from the renorm() function in libint2/shell.h.
