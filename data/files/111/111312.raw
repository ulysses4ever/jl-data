using DataFrames

# The current DataFrame type hierarchy relatively transparently implements
# the notion of a set of named, equal-length, heterogeneous-typed vectors that may include
# missing data.

# An AbstractDataFrame is something that can be indexed in a [rows,cols] syntax.
# It currently inherits Associative functionality, which may be too broad --
# additional experience will be necessary.

#abstract AbstractDataFrame <: Associative{Any,Any}

# The standard implementation of an ADF is a DataFrame. It has a set of columns
# and a set of column names that refer to the columns. (Note that the column
# names are stored in an Index data structure that allows fast lookups and 
# some clever features described below.) Column names are of type ByteString --
# either ASCIIString or UTF8String. The current implementation allows columns
# to be of any type, which may be too broad, as described below.

#type DataFrame <: AbstractDataFrame
#    columns::Vector{Any} 
#    colindex::Index
# ...

# a SubDataFrame is a lightweight wrapper around a DataFrame used most frequently in
# split/apply sorts of operations.
#type SubDataFrame <: AbstractDataFrame
#    parent::DataFrame
#    rows::Vector{Int} # maps from subdf row indexes to parent row indexes
# ...

# The typical column type is a DataVector, which inherits from AbstractDataVector. A 
# DataVector is a vector of some type, along with a Boolean vector that acts as
# a mask for missing data. The decision to use a mask instead of a particular
# value (e.g., NaN + a particular payload for floats) remains contentious, 
# as it is in all other statistical programming languages and frameworks. 
#type DataVector{T} <: AbstractDataVector{T}
#    data::Vector{T}
#    na::AbstractVector{Bool} 

# DataVectors can be built and used independently of DataFrames. For interactive
# use, the type-referencing constructor is handy, and the NA literal is supported.
dvint = DataVector[1, 2, NA, 4]
# DataVectors can also be contructed from existing arrays. Note that the existing
# array is referenced, not copied. In general, the DataFrames.jl philosophy is 
# similar to the overall Julia philosophy -- don't copy data unless requested by 
# the user or otherwise necessary.
x = [5:8]
dvint2 = DataVector(x)
dvint2[1] = 10
print(x)
# Note that assignment of NA to a DataVector does not affect the underlying
# vector, just the mask.
dvint2[2] = NA
print(dvint2)
print(x)

# an aspect of DataVectors that needs to be revisited and likely redesigned is that
# they contain meta-data specifying how the NAs should be treated under 
# certain operations. To create a new DataVector object (with the same data
# and mask objects) that looks as if the NAs are ignored, use naFilter; to 
# define a replacement value, use naReplace.
try sum(dvint) end # fails now -- eventually, this should work.
sum(naFilter(dvint))
sum(naReplace(dvint, 100))

# A PooledDataVector is an implementation of AbstractDataVector that uses indexes into
# a pool of values instead of an array of values, which is space efficient in 
# the case of a large number of repeated elements. A common use is repeated 
# strings. PDVs don't have a mask -- they can use a 0-index to represent the NA.
pdvstr = PooledDataVector["one", "one", "two", "two", NA, "one", "one"]
idump(pdvstr)  # show the internal structure of a PooledDataVector
# some operations, such as csvDataFrame which loads a CSV file into a DataFrame
# will try to created a PooledDataVector when possible.

# A DataFrame is a mix of DataVectors, PooledDataVectors, and (maybe) other vectors

# this useful constructor from an expression unpacks the assignments, converts the LHSs
# to column names, and converts the RHS to DataVectors.

# Let's look at the structure of the data (`dump` is like R's `str`).
dump(df1)

# The names of the columns in a DF are stored in a new type called an Index (possibly
# needs a less-generic name?)
# an AbstractIndex is a thing that can be used to look up ordered things by name, but that
# will also accept a position or set of positions or range or other things and pass them
# through cleanly.
# This makes referencing columns by name or position very simple and flexible.
ii = Index(["cat", "dog", "bird", "turtle"])

# Expressions are used in many places in DataFrames.jl. The functions

# the DataFrame and then eval'ing the expression.

# Because `eval` acts globally, it can pull in global variables but
# not local variables. To insert those, they must be escaped.

# `within(df)` returns the a copy of `df` after evaluating the
# expression. This is most useful for creating new columns from
# existing columns. `within!` is the same but changes the original
# DataFrame.
