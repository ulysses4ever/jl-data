Construct an ellipsoid of revolution with
    
    equatorial radius a,
    flattening f,

Remark, we construct it when constructing a [Projection] using the formulas:

    f = (a − b)/a = 1 − sqrt(1-es)
    n = (a − b)/(a + b) = f /(2 − f)
    es = (a^2 − b^2)/a^2 = f(2 − f)

Solve the direct geodesic problem.

Args:

    g        - the geod_geodesic object specifying the ellipsoid.
    lonlat   - where lat ∈ [-90, 90], lon ∈ [-540, 540), modified in-place to [dest] (described below)
    azimuth  - azimuth (degrees) ∈ [-540, 540)
    distance - distance (metres) to move from (lon,lat); can be negative
   
Returns:

    dest     - destination after moving for [distance] metres in [azimuth] direction.
    azi      - forward azimuth (degrees) at destination [dest].

Remarks:

    If either point is at a pole, the azimuth is defined by keeping the longitude fixed,
    writing lat = 90 +/- eps, and taking the limit as eps -> 0+. An arc length greater than 180deg
    signifies a geodesic which is not a shortest path.
