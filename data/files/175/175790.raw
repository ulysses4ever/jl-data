;; Commentary:

;; The idea is that the `user' module is where all user code gets to
;; play. By default it has a set of modules opened so that it looks
;; pretty much how the old non-modular wm looked.

;; This means that the `sawfish.wm' structures aren't modified by user
;; code, this is a good thing, since it means that modules importing
;; `sawfish.wm.foo' know what they are getting (no random user
;; bindings)

;; The downside is that it's harder for user extensions to redefine
;; existing code, IMHO this may also be a good thing..
