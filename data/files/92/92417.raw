### Utils.BufferedIO

  This type provides a means to buffer IO in memory before writing it to a file.
  Data written to the object is stored in the IOBuffer until flush() is called, 
  when the buffer is (efficiently) dumped into the file

### Utils.BufferedIO

  Constructor for BufferedIO type.  Takes an IOStream and creates an IOBuffer.
  If no IOStream is given, a dummy stream is created.  If a dummy stream is
  used, flush must never be called on the returned BufferedIO object

  Inputs:
    f: and IOStream object, defaults to a dummy stream

  Outputs:
    a BufferedIO object
