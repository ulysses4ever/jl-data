"""
Solve Riccati equation with backward recursion.

The problem to solve is the following (quadratic linear settings):

```
x(t+1) = A * x(t) + B * u(t)

```

with cost:

```
J(t) = x' Q x + u' R u

```

Parameters:
    - `Tf`: final time.
    - `Sf`: final cost.

Returns:
    - `L`: evolution of gains, indexed by time.
