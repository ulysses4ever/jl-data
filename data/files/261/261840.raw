function computeRBFBetas(X::Array{Float64, 2}, centroids::Array{Float64, 2}, memberships::Array{Int64, 1})
# COMPUTERBFBETAS Computes the beta coefficients for all of the specified 
# centroids.
#   betas = computeRBFBetas(X, centroids, memberships)
#   
#   This function computes the beta coefficients based on the average distance
#   between a cluster's data points and its center. The average distance is 
#   called sigma, and beta = 1 / (2*sigma^2).
#
#   Parameters:
#     X           - Matrix of all training samples, one per row.
#     centroids   - Matrix of cluster centers, one per row
#     memberships - Vector specifying the cluster membership of each data point
#                   in X. The membership is specified as the row index of the
#                   centroid in 'centroids'.
#                   
#   Returns:
#     A vector containing the beta coefficient for each centroid.
