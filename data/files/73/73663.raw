## ==========================================

# The probability of breast cancer is 1% for a woman at 40 who
# participates in a routine screening. If a woman has breast cancer, the probability is
# 80% that she will have a positive mammography. If a woman does not have breast cancer,
# the probability is 9.6% that she will also have a positive mammography.
# A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.

# What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?

# Ground truth
