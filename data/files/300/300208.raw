# need function to check if after updateContainRoot! there is no place for the root
# careful because updateContainRoot changes things, so maybe we want to be careful and only change
# if the new hybridization is going to stay

# think of the process of adding a hybrid edge:
# updateInCycle: what happens if cycle intersects, can we go back?
# updateContainRoot: what happens if containRoot is empty, can we go back?

# todo: function to create an hybrid edge:
# - make sure the hybridization is "identifiable": not between the same edge, or in a cherry
# - detect whether the new cycle would overlap with another cycle already in the network.
#   just check that the 2 edges to be connected are not already marked as
#   being on a cycle: updateInCycle! returns false
# - detect where the cycle is: i think it always starts in the hybrid node, so simply use searchHybridNode, or use the hybrid node just created
# - mark edges along the cycle with the number of the hybrid edge/node: updateInCycle!
# - create the new nodes and edges, with correct hybrid labels
# - mark which edges can contain the root, check that the set of edges that
#   can contain the root is non-empty: updateContainRoot, still need function to check if empty
# - check cycle configuration (value of k, and clade sizes ni)
#   if bad triangle: set gammaz and gamma2z for appropriate nodes
#   if bad diamond: gammaz for the "other" node (one just created) of each hybrid edge
#   if some parameters need to be set to 0:
# - identify the second hybrid edge, mark it as hybrid
# - depending on gamma, mark one of the 2 edges as the major "tree" edge

# todo: functions to propose a new network
# example: pick 2 edges and add a hybrid edge to link the 2
# todo: function to change direction of hybrid edge (hybrid edge  =  hybrid&&!isMajor),
#                    source or recipient of either hybrid edge, to propose new network


# todo: function readNetwork!(network::Network, string) # check string as parameter
# C function to read in tree (recursive) in mbsum*,
# maybe start reading a tree, and then add the hybrid edge(s)
# string will contain the parenthetical format, maybe not needed as parameter, but as return


# todo: function printTopology!(string, network::Network) # parameters

# todo: function network2Tree(network::Network) function to remove a hybrid edge and transform the network in tree?

# todo: function to reduce network to quartet: think of rules of how to remove hybrid edges, and when do we need to keep them and when not.

# todo: function to check that everything in network makes sense (gamma, t, gammaz, hybrid edges pointing at hybrid nodes, 2 hybrid edges: one major, one minor)

# todo: function to identify bad diamond/triangle in a network?
