@doc """
An Interval represents all values between and including its two endpoints.
Intervals are parameterized by the type of its endpoints; this type must be
a concrete leaf type that supports a partial ordering. Promoting arithmetic
is defined for Intervals of `Number` and `Dates.AbstractTime`.

### Type parameters

```julia
immutable Interval{T}
```
* `T` : the type of the interval's endpoints. Must be a concrete leaf type.

### Constructors

```julia
Interval(a, b)
a .. b
```

### Arguments

* `a` : lower bound of the interval
* `b` : upper bound of the interval

### Examples

```julia
A = AxisArray(collect(1:20), Axis{:time}(.1:.1:2.0))
A[Interval(0.2,0.5)]
A[0.0 .. 0.5]
```

# Promotion rules for "promiscuous" types like Intervals and SIUnits, which both
# simply wrap any Number, are often ambiguous. That is, which type should "win"
# -- is the promotion between an SIUnit and an Interval an SIQuantity{Interval}
# or is it an Interval{SIQuantity}? For our uses in AxisArrays, though, we can
# sidestep this problem by making Intervals *not* a subtype of Number. Then in
# order for them to plug into the promotion system, we *extend* the promoting
# operator behaviors to Union{Number, Interval}. This way other types can
# similarly define their own extensions to the promoting operators without fear
# of ambiguity -- there will simply be, e.g.,
#
# f(x::Number, y::Number) = f(promote(x,y)...) # in base
# f(x::Union{Number, Interval}, y::Union{Number, Interval}) = f(promote(x,y)...)
# f(x::Union{Number, T}, y::Union{Number, T}) = f(promote(x,y)...)
#
# In this way, these "promiscuous" types will never interact unless explicitly
# made subtypes of Number or otherwise defined with knowledge of eachother. The
# downside is that Intervals are not as useful as they could be; they really
# could be considered as <: Number themselves. We do this in general for any
# supported Scalar:
typealias Scalar Union{Number, Dates.AbstractTime}
