@doc """ 

Function to graph, using ascii characters, a predicate related to a
two-dimensional equation, such as `f == 0` or `f < g`, where `f` and
`g` are functions, e.g., `f(x,y) = y - sqrt(x)`. The positional
arguments are `L`, `R`, `B`, `T` which indicate the x-y range of the 
graph of the equation. The keywork arguments `W` and `H` indicate the number
of pixels to use.

Set `offset=0` to see algorithm

A pixel is important, as the graph will color a pixel

- "white" (e.g., " ") if no solution exists in the region indicated by the pixel
- "black" (e.g., "x") if a solution is known to exist in the region
- red (e.g. ".") if a solution _might_ exist
