"""
Add a column to a QR factorization without using Q.

`R = qraddcol(A,R,v)`  adds the m-vector `v` to the QR factorization of the
m-by-n matrix `A` without using `Q`. On entry, `R` is a dense n-by-n upper
triangular matrix such that `R'*R = A'*A`.

`R = qraddcol(A,R,v,β)` is similar to the above, except that the
routine updates the QR factorization of

[A; β I],   and   R'*R = (A'*A + β^2*I) = R'*R.

`A` should have fewer columns than rows.  `A` and `v` may be sparse or
dense.  On exit, `R` is the (n+1)-by-(n+1) factor corresponding to

  Anew = [A        V ],    Rnew = [R   u  ],   Rnew'Rnew = Anew'Anew.
         [beta*I     ]            [  gamma]
         [       beta]

The new column `v` is assumed to be nonzero.
If `A` has no columns yet, input `A = []`, `R = []`.

                 Where necessary, Ake Bjorck's CSNE
                 (Corrected Semi-Normal Equations) method
                 is used to improve the accuracy of u and gamma.
                 See p143 of Ake Bjork's Least Squares book.
    18 Jun 2007: R is now the exact size on entry and exit.
    19 Oct 2007: Sparse A, a makes c and u sparse.
                 Force them to be dense.
                 For dense R we probably should use linsolve,
                 which requires c and u to be dense anyway.
    04 Aug 2008: QRaddcol2 updates u using du, rather than
                 u = R*z as in Ake's book.
                 We guess that it might be slightly more accurate,
                 but it's hard to tell.  No R*z makes it a little cheaper.
    03 Sep 2008: Generalize A to be [A; beta*I] for some scalar beta.
                 Update u using du, but keep Ake's version in comments.

Delete the k-th column and update a Q-less QR factorization.
