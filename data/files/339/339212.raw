# This module helps generate complex polyhedron commands for OpenSCAD.
# The key function is generatePolyhedron, which takes an initial set of points
# and faces, a set of transformations, and a dictionary of symmetries. All the
# transforms are applied to the initial base polyhedron, resulting in a new set
# of points and faces. However the symmetry dictionary is used to eradicate
# duplicate points, so that the resulting polyhedron can be described as simply
# as possible.

# Background
# The polyhedron command in OpenSCAD looks like this:
# polyhedron(points = [[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]],
#         faces = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]])
# Note that the faces must be specified clocwise, when viewing the final shape from
# the outside.

# point in the points array of the polyhedron object being built.
# This allows duplicate points to not be recorded in the polyhedron object,
# since the same index can be recorded multiple times in this object.
