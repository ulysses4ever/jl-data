"""Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

Important members are fit, predict.

GridSearchCV implements a "fit" method and a "predict" method like
any classifier except that the parameters of the classifier
used to predict is optimized by cross-validation.

Parameters
----------
estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
    A object of that type is instantiated for each grid point.

param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
    Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
    parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
    dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
    in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
    of parameter settings.

scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
    A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
    a scorer callable object / function with signature
    ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

fit_params : dict, optional
    Parameters to pass to the fit method.

n_jobs : int, default 1
    Number of jobs to run in parallel.

pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
    Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
    execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
    explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
    than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

        - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
          created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
          fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
          spawning of the jobs

        - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
          spawned

        - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
          as in '2*n_jobs'

iid : boolean, default=True
    If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
    the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
    and not the mean loss across the folds.

cv : integer or cross-validation generator, default=3
    If an integer is passed, it is the number of folds.
    Specific cross-validation objects can be passed, see
    sklearn.cross_validation module for the list of possible objects

refit : boolean, default=True
    Refit the best estimator with the entire dataset.
    If "False", it is impossible to make predictions using
    this GridSearchCV instance after fitting.

verbose : integer
    Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
    Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
    If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
    FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
    step, which will always raise the error.


Examples
--------
>>> from sklearn import svm, grid_search, datasets
>>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
>>> parameters = {'kernel':('linear', 'rbf'), 'C':[1, 10]}
>>> svr = svm.SVC()
>>> clf = grid_search.GridSearchCV(svr, parameters)
>>> clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
...                             # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
GridSearchCV(cv=None, error_score=...,
       estimator=SVC(C=1.0, cache_size=..., class_weight=..., coef0=...,
                     degree=..., gamma=..., kernel='rbf', max_iter=-1,
                     probability=False, random_state=None, shrinking=True,
                     tol=..., verbose=False),
       fit_params={}, iid=..., n_jobs=1,
       param_grid=..., pre_dispatch=..., refit=...,
       scoring=..., verbose=...)


Attributes
----------
grid_scores_ : list of named tuples
    Contains scores for all parameter combinations in param_grid.
    Each entry corresponds to one parameter setting.
    Each named tuple has the attributes:

        * ``parameters``, a dict of parameter settings
        * ``mean_validation_score``, the mean score over the
          cross-validation folds
        * ``cv_validation_scores``, the list of scores for each fold

best_estimator_ : estimator
    Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
    which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
    on the left out data. Not available if refit=False.

best_score_ : float
    Score of best_estimator on the left out data.

best_params_ : dict
    Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

scorer_ : function
    Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
    parameters for the model.

Notes
------
The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the left out
data, unless an explicit score is passed in which case it is used instead.

If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
point in the grid (and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
`pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
n_jobs`.

# RandomizedSearchCV

"""Randomized search on hyper parameters.

RandomizedSearchCV implements a "fit" method and a "predict" method like
any classifier except that the parameters of the classifier
used to predict is optimized by cross-validation.

In contrast to GridSearchCV, not all parameter values are tried out, but
rather a fixed number of parameter settings is sampled from the specified
distributions. The number of parameter settings that are tried is
given by n_iter.

If all parameters are presented as a list,
sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter
is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used.
It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous
parameters.

Parameters
----------
estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
    A object of that type is instantiated for each parameter setting.

param_distributions : dict
    Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and distributions
    or lists of parameters to try. Distributions must provide a ``rvs``
    method for sampling (such as those from scipy.stats.distributions).
    If a list is given, it is sampled uniformly.

n_iter : int, default=10
    Number of parameter settings that are sampled. n_iter trades
    off runtime vs quality of the solution.

scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
    A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
    a scorer callable object / function with signature
    ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

fit_params : dict, optional
    Parameters to pass to the fit method.

n_jobs : int, default=1
    Number of jobs to run in parallel.

pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
    Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
    execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
    explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
    than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

        - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
          created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
          fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
          spawning of the jobs

        - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
          spawned

        - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
          as in '2*n_jobs'

iid : boolean, default=True
    If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
    the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
    and not the mean loss across the folds.

cv : integer or cross-validation generator, optional
    If an integer is passed, it is the number of folds (default 3).
    Specific cross-validation objects can be passed, see
    sklearn.cross_validation module for the list of possible objects

refit : boolean, default=True
    Refit the best estimator with the entire dataset.
    If "False", it is impossible to make predictions using
    this RandomizedSearchCV instance after fitting.

verbose : integer
    Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
    Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
    If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
    FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit

        * ``mean_validation_score``, the mean score over the
          cross-validation folds

best_estimator_ : estimator
    Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
    which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
    on the left out data. Not available if refit=False.

best_score_ : float
    Score of best_estimator on the left out data.

best_params_ : dict
    Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

Notes
-----
The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the held-out
data, according to the scoring parameter.

If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
parameter setting(and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
