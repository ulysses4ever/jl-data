"""
Count number of displacement vector lengths k-sigma from the group mean

Args:

* vectors: 4xN array of points (start and end points of displacement vectors)
* k: number of sigmas to set the threshold for counting

Returns:

* integer for number of displacement vectors above the k-sigma threshold

  num = count_outliers(vectors, k)
