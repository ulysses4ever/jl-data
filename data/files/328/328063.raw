"""
Finds the peaks and valleys of a series.

Parameters
---
- **xs** : This is your series.
- **up_thresh** : The minimum relative change necessary to define a peak.
- **down_thesh** : The minimum relative change necessary to define a valley.

Returns
---
an array with 0 indicating no pivot and -1 and 1 indicating valley and peak
respectively.


The First and Last Elements
---
The first and last elements are guaranteed to be annotated as peak or
valley even if the segments formed do not have the necessary relative
changes. This is a tradeoff between technical correctness and the
propensity to make mistakes in data analysis. The possible mistake is
ignoring data outside the fully realized segments, which may bias analysis.
