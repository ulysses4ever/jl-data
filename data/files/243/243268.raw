#create a graph

## add a node
## add a list of edges
## add all the nodes from another graph

## add an edge
## add a list of edges
## add all the edges from another graph

## remove a node
## remove all the nodes from a graph

## count the number of nodes
## count the number of edges

## list all the nodes
## list all the edges
## list all the neighbors of one node

## iterate through all the nodes and do something else
## iterate through all the edges and do something else

## read a graph from the edge list from file

## print connected components of a graph
## print degrees of a graph
