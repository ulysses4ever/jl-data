    is_header_equal(original, expected) -> Bool

Compares a header line returned from the server with a simplified pattern matching that
supports `...` to match any number of characters and `||` which allows for alternatives.
Note we could use regular expressions directly to compare the headers but this can be
annoying to escape most of the expected headers. If more and more functionality is needed
to match against headers regular expressions should be used instead.
