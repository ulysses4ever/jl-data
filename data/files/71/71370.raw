#= Talk title:
  Analysis of Martian soil composition on Mars using light induced
  breakdown spectroscopy=#

#next step, interesting area to look at potassium because it is very variable
#only fit oxygen line or something, I don't know. I'm sick
#=play with ratios,
  - Normalize with oxygen
  - Check ratios of other peaks of the same element
    - e.g. peak area overtime
    - e.g. peaks from different spectrum
    - e.g. abundance calculation

  - First question from Vlad, "that can't be true, are you sure you did it right?"
  - Always check data for consistancy
