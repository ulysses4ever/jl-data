## Types for different kinds of Arrows
## ==================================

"A functional unit which transforms `I` inputs to `O` outputs"

"""An entry or exit to an Arrow, analogous to argument position of multivariate function.

  A port is uniquely determined by the arrow it belongs to and a pin.
  By convention, a port which is on the parent arrow will have `arrowid = 1`.
  `pinid`s are contingous from `1:I` or `1:O` for inputs and outputs respectively.

  On the boundary of a composite arrow, ports are simultaneously inports (since they take
  input from outside world) and outputs (since inside they project outward to
  subarrows)."""
