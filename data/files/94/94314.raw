### EulerEquationMod.extractKeys

  This function reads a text file that describes the keys used for the PDESolver
  options dictonary and generates a julia source file declaring a dictonary 
  named `known_keys`.  This dictonary can be used to check the options dictonary
  to see if any unrecognized keys are present.

  The text file must be formatted as follows:
    if a line contains a new key, it must be inclosed in double quotes, and 
    the first character of the line must be a double quote.

    Lines not meeting this specification are ignored.

    Inputs:
      fin: an ASCIIString containing the name (or path) of the file to be read
      fout: name of file to write the dictonary to
    
    Keyword Args:
      header: true if this is the first text file being processed
      footer: true if this is the last text file being processed

    The header and footer options enable reading several text files and writing
    them to a single output file

### write_arbitrary_keys

Function that allows you to write multiple instances of any key that one wants
in a file. The output will appear as the desired string value appended by a 
number.

**Inputs**

*  `fout` : File to which the key is to be written
*  `stringval` : String value of the key
*  `counts` : Number of instances of the key value desired

Example: 
If you want 3 keys like `hello1`, `hello2` and `hello3` in a file 
`fout.jl`, The arguent will be as follows

`write_arbitrary_keys("fout.jl", "hello", 3)`

The corresponding output to file is
`
"hello1" => true
"hello2" => true
"hello3" => true
`
