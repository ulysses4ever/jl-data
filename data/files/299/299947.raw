"""Returns the quality factors (ratios of center frequencies over bandwidths).

There is a classical tradeoff between spatial and frequential localizations
in a filter bank. We address it by supporting two user specifications
* spatial localization: `max_scale` sets the maximal wavelet scale, in the sense
  of squared-magnitude full width at tenth maximum (FWTM).
* frequential localization: `max_qualityfactor` set the quality factor (ratio
  between center frequency and 3dB bandwidth) in absence of spatial localization
  constraints.

For each center frequency, the quality factor and the scale are governed by the
following criteria, in decreasing priority order:
1. quality factor is equal or greater than `1.0`
2. scale is equal or smaller than `max_scale`
3. quality factor is equal to `max_qualityfactor`

To localize Morlet wavelets according to user-defined max_qualityfactor and
max_scale, we proceed with the following steps:
1. compute center frequencies `ξs` and uncertainty `h`,
2. compute unbounded scales `max_qualityfactor/(h*ξs)`,
3. bound scales from above by `max_scale`,
4. compute unbounded quality factors `scales.*ξs/h``, and
5. bound quality factors from below by `1.0`.
