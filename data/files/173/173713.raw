;;; Description

;; This function either focusses a given window, or starts
;; the application instead.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; => application gnome-run-dialog matched on it's WM_CLASS
;; ( bind-keys global-keymap "W-F2"
;;   `( jump-or-exec "Gnome-run-dialog" "gnome-run-dialog" #:match-class t ) )
;;
;; => application geany matched on it's WM_NAME
;; ( bind-keys global-keymap "W-F10"
;;   `( jump-or-exec "Geany" "geany" #:match-class nil ) )
;;
;; NOTE: `#:match-class nil' can be skipped, as it's nil by default
;;
;; In version 1.0.0 toggle-or-exec was merged into jump-or-exec. It's basically
;; the same, but it turns windows into drop-down-terminal like ones, that means
;; then you press the key while on the corresponding window, it will be hidden.
;; Optionally you may add a window-matcher, wich will also hide the window when
;; you leave it (not done by default).
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; => application dolphin matched on it's WM_NAME 
;;  => will be iconified when key pressed while it's focused
;;  ( bind-keys global-keymap "Home" 
;;    `( jump-or-exec "Dolphin" "dolphin ~" #:onfocused jump-or-exec-leave ) 
;;
;; => application konsole matched on it's WM_CLASS
;;  => will be iconified when key pressed while it's focused
;;  => will also be iconified when the cursor leaves it
;;  ( bind-keys global-keymap "F12"
;;    `( jump-or-exec "Konsole" "konsole" #:match-class t #:onfocused jump-or-exec-leave ) 
;;
;;  ( add-window-matcher '( ( WM_CLASS . "^Konsole/konsole$" ) )
;;    '( ( iconify-on-leave .t ) ) )
