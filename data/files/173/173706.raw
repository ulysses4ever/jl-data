;;; Description

;; This function either focusses a given window, or starts
;; the application instead.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; NOTE: the `t' tells jump-or-exec to match on WM_CLASS
;; ( bind-keys global-keymap "W-F2"
;;   `( jump-or-exec "Gnome-run-dialog" "gnome-run-dialog" t ) )
;;
;; NOTE: a missing `t' or a `nil' (the later is required if making
;;       use of the `onfocused' arguement) tells jump-or-exec to
;;       match on WM_NAME
;; ( bind-keys global-keymap "W-F10"
;;   `( jump-or-exec "Geany" "geany" nil ) )
