#   SAVE_SCRIPTS(FILENAME,SCRIPTS) saves a structure holding the encounter
#   scripts stored to the specified file.
#
#   SCRIPTS FILE:
#   The scripts file contains a set of scripted encounters. Each 
#   encounter is defined by a set of encounter scripts associated with a 
#   fixed number of aircraft. The file is organized as follows:
#
#   [Header]
#   uint32 (number of encounters)
#   uint32 (number of aircraft)
#       [Encounter 1]
#           [Initial]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               double (initial airspeed in ft/s)
#               double (initial north position in ft)
#               double (initial east position in ft)
#               double (initial altitude in ft)
#               double (initial heading angle in radians)
#               double (initial flight path angle in radians)
#               double (initial roll angle in radians)
#               double (initial airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#               double (initial airspeed in ft/s)
#               double (initial north position in ft)
#               double (initial east position in ft)
#               double (initial altitude in ft)
#               double (initial heading angle in radians)
#               double (initial flight path angle in radians)
#               double (initial roll angle in radians)
#               double (initial airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#           [Updates]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               uint8 (number of updates)
#                   [Update 1]
#                   double (time in s)
#                   double (commanded vertical rate in ft/s)
#                   double (commanded turn rate in rad/s)
#                   double (commanded airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#                   ...
#                   [Update m]
#                   double (time in s)
#                   double (commanded vertical rate in ft/s)
#                   double (commanded turn rate in rad/s)
#                   double (commanded airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#                   ...
#       ...
#       [Encounter k]
#           ...

#   SCRIPTS STRUCTURE:
#   The scripts structure is an m x n structure matrix, where m is the
#   number of aircraft and n is the number of encounters. This structure
#   matrix has two fields: initial and update. The initial field is an 8
#   element array specifying the airspeed, north position, east position,
#   altitude, heading, flight path angle, roll angle, and airspeed
#   acceleration. The update field is a 4 x n matrix, where n is the number
#   of updates. The rows correspond to the time, vertical rate, turn rate
#   and airspeed acceleration.

# Inputs:
#       filename: name of output file
#
#       encounters: structure of encounters to save to file specified by
#       "filename".  For a guide to the format of this structure, see
#       the help documentation in load_scripts.m.  
#
#       varargin: parameter/value pairs
#
#           +   parameter: numupdatetype
#
#               value (character string): data type of "num_update"
#               variable: the number of updates scripted for some aircraft
#               in some encounter (default is 'uint32')
#
#           +   parameter: append
#
#               value (logical): set to true to append encounters to the
#               end of the file specified by "filename".  Set to false
#               (default) to write a new file with the name specified by
#               "filename".
#
#           +   parameter: floattype
#
#               value (character string): data type of encounter initial
#               conditions and updates (default is 'double')
