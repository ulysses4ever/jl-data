import Base.(==)

# TODO overload == for rows, tables and indices where they are simply reordered
# TODO similarly to ==, need to push! a reorederd row onto a table. Currently seems to cause an infinite loop. (Think about vcat, too? Or a nice way of matching orderings?)
# TODO Figure out namespace issues for head and tail
# TODO Missing methods: vcat and hcat for tables, unshift!,
# TODO Indexing by number of a Table/Row could give a Column/Cell (a bit confusing for table... maybe like table[:,1] vs table[1,:])
# TODO fix TableKey so it always references the length of the current table, not its parent
# TODO possibly implement subtable (with no ability to push! or change rows, though can setindex!)
# TODO join for row, join for table, somehow make sense of the key mess
# TODO sub for generating a sub-table (i.e. simply a table with different StorageTypes)
# TODO other DataFrames things like unique!
# TODO finish DenseTable
# TODO implement KeyTable ?
# TODO implement DenseKeyTable ?
# TODO other types of computed joins, map, do, etc
