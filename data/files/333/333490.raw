  description=["One and two dimensional simplex grids",
    "  This module provides the grid implementation 'FoamGrid'. FoamGrid implements one- and",
    "  two-dimensional simplex grids, which can be embedded in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary",
    "  dimension. As a special feature, FoamGrid does not require the grids to be manifolds.",
    "  All sorts of T-junctions, singular points and the like are allowed. This makes FoamGrid",
    "  particularly suited to model objects like foams, fracture networks, neuron trees, root",
    "  networks, and others. FoamGrid is a self-contained grid implementation, and does not",
    "  depend on an external library."
