#= Some of the following tests compare hashes of Matlab results with hashes of Julia results. The general procedure was to apply a Matlab function to data, port the result to Julia in binary *.mat format (using Julia's MAT package,) and to compute the hash in Julia. The hash was then hard-coded into the test for comparison with the result of a similar procedure using the equivalent Julia function and data.

    # Hash of Matlab `clustering_coef_wd` applied to fve30;
    mathash = 0x173a26ddf4f29951;

    # Matlab `clustering_coef_wd` applied to Group Average data matches
    # corresponding Julia run to 15 decimal places. Hash of Julia
    # run is used below.
