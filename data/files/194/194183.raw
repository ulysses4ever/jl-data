# This implements a "trivial geography" similar to Spector and Kline (2006)
# by first sampling an individual randomly and then selecting additional
# individuals for the same tournament within a certain deme of limited size
# for the sub-sequent individuals in the population. The version we implement
# here is from:
#  I. Harvey, "The Microbial Genetic Algorithm", in Advances in Artificial Life
#  Darwin Meets von Neumann, Springer, 2011.
# The original paper is:
#  Spector, L., and J. Klein. 2005. Trivial Geography in Genetic Programming.
#  In Genetic Programming Theory and Practice III, edited by T. Yu, R.L. Riolo,
#  and B. Worzel, pp. 109-124. Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers.

  # The radius must be at least as big as the number of samples + 2 so that

  psize = popsize(population)
  deme_start = rand(1:psize)
  indices = sample(deme_start:(deme_start+radius-1), numSamples; replace = false)
  # Ensure they are not out of bounds by wrapping over at the end.
  map(indices) do index
    if index > psize
      mod(index-1, psize) + 1 # We have to increase by 1 since Julia arrays start indices at 1
