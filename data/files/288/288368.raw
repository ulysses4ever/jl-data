Returns a `Vector` with the result of the AMG solver.

### `kwargs`  (copy-pasted from Python docs)

* `x0` : Initial guess.
* `tol` : Stopping criteria: relative residual r[k]/r[0] tolerance.
* `maxiter` : Stopping criteria: maximum number of allowable iterations.
* `cycle` : {"V","W","F","AMLI"}
    Type of multigrid cycle to perform in each iteration.
* `accel` : Defines acceleration method.  Can be a string such as "cg"
    or "gmres" which is the name of an iterative solver in
    `pyamg.krylov` (preferred) or scipy.sparse.linalg.isolve.
    If accel is not a string, it will be treated like a function
    with the same interface provided by the iterative solvers in SciPy.
        (the function version is not tested in Julia!)
* `callback` : User-defined function called after each iteration.  It is
    called as callback(xk) where xk is the k-th iterate vector.
* `residuals` : List to contain residual norms at each iteration.

Wrapper for `solver_diagnostics`, which is part of PyAMG-Examples. To use it
clone [PyAMG-Examples](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg-examples), then make the

(e.g., from `pyamg-examples/solver_diagnostics`, but the file could be copied
anywhere.

If succesful, `diagnostics(A)` will try a variety of parameter combinations for
`smoothed_aggregation_solver`, and write two files 'solver_diagnostic.txt' and
'solver_diagnostic.py' which contain information how to generate the best
solver.
