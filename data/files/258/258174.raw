MPC RW  Magick Persistent Cache image file format   The most efficient data processing pattern is a write-once, read-many-times pattern. The image is generated or copied from source, then various analyses are performed on the image pixels over time. MPC supports this pattern. MPC is the native in-memory ImageMagick uncompressed file format. This file format is identical to that used by ImageMagick to represent images in memory and is read by mapping the file directly into memory. The MPC format is not portable and is not suitable as an archive format. It is suitable as an intermediate format for high-performance image processing. The MPC format requires two files to support one image. Image attributes are written to a file with the extension .mpc, whereas, image pixels are written to a file with the extension .cache.
MPR RW  Magick Persistent Registry  This format permits you to write to and read images from memory. The image persists until the program exits. For example, let's use the MPR to create a checkerboard:

Some PDF files, however, have a CropBox or TrimBox that is smaller than the MediaBox and may include white space, registration or cutting marks outside the CropBox or TrimBox. To force ImageMagick to use the CropBox or TrimBox rather than the MediaBox, use -define (e.g. -define pdf:use-cropbox=true or -define pdf:use-trimbox=true). Use -density to improve the appearance of your PDF rendering (e.g. -density 300x300). Use -alpha remove to remove transparency. To specify direct conversion from Postscript to PDF, use -define delegate:bimodel=true. Use -define pdf:fit-page=true to scale to the page size.

PNM RW  Portable anymap PNM is a family of formats supporting portable bitmaps (PBM) , graymaps (PGM), and pixmaps (PPM). There is no file format associated with pnm itself. If PNM is used as the output format specifier, then ImageMagick automagically selects the most appropriate format to represent the image. The default is to write the binary version of the formats. Use -compress none to write the ASCII version of the formats.
PPM RW  Portable pixmap format (color)  
PS  RW  Adobe PostScript file   Requires Ghostscript to read. To force ImageMagick to respect the crop box, use -define (e.g. -define eps:use-cropbox=true). Use -density to improve the appearance of your Postscript rendering (e.g. -density 300x300). Use -alpha remove to remove transparency. To specify direct conversion from PDF to Postscript, use -define delegate:bimodel=true.

TIFF    RW  Tagged Image File Format    Also known as TIF. Requires tiff-v3.6.1.tar.gz or later. Use -define to specify the rows per strip (e.g. -define tiff:rows-per-strip=8). To define the tile geometry, use for example, -define tiff:tile-geometry=128x128. To specify a signed format, use -define quantum:format=signed. To specify a single-precision floating-point format, use -define quantum:format=floating-point. Set the depth to 64 for a double-precision floating-point format. Use -define quantum:polarity=min-is-black or -define quantum:polarity=min-is-white toggle the photometric interpretation for a bilevel image. Specify the extra samples as associated or unassociated alpha with, for example, -define tiff:alpha=unassociated. Set the fill order with -define tiff:fill-order=msb|lsb. Set the TIFF endianess with -define tiff:endian=msb|lsb. Use -define tiff:exif-properties=false to skip reading the EXIF properties.
