@doc """
A type to store the operation enocded in an alignment (CIGAR Operations).
Also stores the position in the alignment view of the sequences, and the
corresponding position in the unaltered source sequence (nucleotide or protein).

It stores the position values as Int types and the alignment operation is stored
as a type `Operation`, these are defined in the file `operations.jl` and loaded
into Bio.Align namespace as a series of global constants.

Calling the AlignmentAnchor default constructor with default arguments sets both
integer fields to 0, and the operation field to the global constant OP_INVALID.

# Sorting AlignmentAnchors
# ------------------------

#=
In order to make use of Julia's sorting API and avoid having to write our own,
whilst ALSO avoiding slowing down things by passing functions about as arguments
to other functions, we make use of how the sort API constructs its searching and
sorting algorithms. It uses types that inherit from the Ordering abstract type,
and this type, combined with use of different Base.Order.lt methods - define how
the values in the array are compared to the query value and in what order.
So we take advantage of this and define our own types inheriting from
Base.Order.Ordering and create our own lt methods. These will then be used by
the core Julia sorting API efficiently.
