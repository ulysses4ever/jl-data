    Parameterizations

Useful parameterizations that map various constrained parameters to
the real line or ``R^n``.  The naming convention follows:

```julia
p = XXX_param(x, args...)
x = XXX_value(p, args...)
log_jacobian = XXX_logjac(x, p, args...)
```

where `log_jacobian` gives ``\log \left| \frac{\mathrm{d}
x}{\mathrm{d} p} \right|``, which is the approprate factor to multiply
a density in `x` to produce a density in `p`.  In other words,
`log_jacobian` is the factor that should be introduced into the prior
to properly account for the reparameterization.

Scalar parameterizations also have vector-based versions.
