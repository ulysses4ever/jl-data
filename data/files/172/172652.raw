"""`TBModel`: basic non-self consistent tight binding calculator. This 
type admits TB models where the Hamiltonian is of the form

    H_ij = f_hop(r_ij)   if i =Ì¸ j
    H_ii = f_os( {r_ij}_j ) 

i.e. the hopping terms is a pair potential while the on-site terms are 
more general; this is consistent in particular with the NRL TB model.
This model can only descibe a single species of atoms.
