# These routines simplify the multiplication of two operators
# they are currently used for dekron of PDEs to make sure equivalent operators are
# recognized as the same
# I put this in Extras as it's currently a "hack"
#
# In the future, product rule/etc. could be implemented, and some sort of ordering
# to recognize M[f,C^(1)] Conversion(T,C^(1))==Conversion(T,C^(1))M[f,T]
