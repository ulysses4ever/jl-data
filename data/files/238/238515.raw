    tikhonov(B::TransferMatrix, v::MModes; tolerance=0.0) -> Alm

Solve for the spherical harmonic coefficients with the given
transfer matrix and m-modes. `tolerance` acts as Tikhonov
regularization parameter that alleviates some of the numerical
problems with this process.

Note that the interferometer cannot see the entire sky. A northern hemisphere
telescope will never see the southern hemisphere. This means that there
must be some information about the sky that is lost during the act of
observing the sky. In linear algebra this means that the transfer matrix
must be singular, and we will therefore need some amount of numerical
regularization to invert it.
