# This file calculates scattering from the Helmholtz equation via the adaptive spectral method.
# Δu + k^2u = 0,
# u|Γ = 0,
# u^i = e^{im k x⋅d},
# u = u^i + u^s.
# The normal derivative ∂u/∂n of the entire wave is calculated on the sound-soft boundaries.
# The scattered wave is calculated by convolving ∂u/∂n with the fundamental solution.
# Then, the total wave is obtained by summing the incident and the scattered waves.
