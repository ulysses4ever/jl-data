Creates a reaction module. If the code is compiled with the preprocessor directive
USE_OPENMP, the reaction module is multithreaded. If the code is compiled
with the preprocessor directive USE_MPI, the reaction module will use MPI
and multiple processes. If neither preprocessor directive is used,
the reaction module will be serial (unparallelized).

Parameters
nxyz	The number of grid cells in the user's model.
n_threads	(or comm, MPI) When using OPENMP, the argument (nthreads) is
the number of worker threads to be used. If nthreads <= 0, the number of
threads is set equal to the number of processors of the computer. When using MPI,
the argument (comm) is the MPI communicator to use within the reaction module.
Return values
Id	of the PhreeqcRM instance, negative is failure (See RM_DecodeError).

N sets of component concentrations are converted to SOLUTIONs numbered 1-n in the Utility IPhreeqc. The solutions can be reacted and manipulated with the methods of IPhreeqc. If solution concentration units (RM_SetUnitsSolution) are per liter, one liter of solution is created in the Utility instance; if solution concentration units are mass fraction, one kilogram of solution is created in the Utility instance. The motivation for this method is the mixing of solutions in wells, where it may be necessary to calculate solution properties (pH for example) or react the mixture to form scale minerals. The code fragments below make a mixture of concentrations and then calculate the pH of the mixture.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
c	Array of concentrations to be made SOLUTIONs in Utility IPhreeqc. Array storage is equivalent to Fortran (n,ncomps).
n	The number of sets of concentrations.
tc	Array of temperatures to apply to the SOLUTIONs, in degree C. Array of size n.

"""
Provides a mapping from grid cells in the user's model to reaction cells in PhreeqcRM. The mapping is used to eliminate inactive cells and to use symmetry to decrease the number of cells for which chemistry must be run. The array of size nxyz (the number of grid cells, RM_GetGridCellCount) must contain the set of all integers 0 <= i < count_chemistry, where count_chemistry is a number less than or equal to nxyz. Inactive cells are assigned a negative integer. The mapping may be many-to-one to account for symmetry.

Returns the number of items in the list of all elements in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Elements are those that have been defined in a solution or any other reactant (EQUILIBRIUM_PHASE, KINETICS, and others). The method can be called multiple times and the list that is created is cummulative. The list is the set of components that needs to be transported. By default the list includes water, excess H and excess O (the H and O not contained in water); alternatively, the list may be set to contain total H and total O (RM_SetComponentH2O), which requires transport results to be accurate to eight or nine significant digits. If multicomponent diffusion (MCD) is to be modeled, there is a capability to retrieve aqueous species concentrations (RM_GetSpeciesConcentrations) and to set new solution concentrations after MCD by using individual species concentrations (RM_SpeciesConcentrations2Module). To use these methods the save-species property needs to be turned on (RM_SetSpeciesSaveOn). If the save-species property is on, RM_FindComponents will generate a list of aqueous species (RM_GetSpeciesCount, RM_GetSpeciesName), their diffusion coefficients at 25 C (RM_GetSpeciesD25), their charge (RM_GetSpeciesZ).

For concentration units of per liter, the solution volume is used to calculate the concentrations for c. For mass fraction concentration units, the solution mass is used to calculate concentrations for c. Two options are available for the volume and mass of solution that are used in converting to transport concentrations: (1) the volume and mass of solution are calculated by PHREEQC, or (2) the volume of solution is the product of saturation (RM_SetSaturation), porosity (RM_SetPorosity), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume), and the mass of solution is volume times density as defined by RM_SetDensity. RM_UseSolutionDensityVolume determines which option is used. For option 1, the databases that have partial molar volume definitions needed to accurately calculate solution volume are phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.

Phreeqc allows multiple selected-output definitions, each of which is assigned a nonnegative integer identifier by the user. The number of definitions can be obtained by RM_GetSelectedOutputCount. To cycle through all of the definitions, RM_GetNthSelectedOutputUserNumber can be used to identify the user number for each selected-output definition in sequence. RM_SetCurrentSelectedOutputUserNumber is then used to select that user number for selected-output processing.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
n	The sequence number of the selected-output definition for which the user number will be returned. C, 0 based.
Return values
The	user number of the nth selected-output definition, negative is failure (See RM_DecodeError).

"""
Returns a vector of saturations (sat) as calculated by the reaction module. Reactions will change the volume of solution in a cell. The transport code must decide whether to ignore or account for this change in solution volume due to reactions. Following reactions, the cell saturation is calculated as solution volume (RM_GetSolutionVolume) divided by the product of representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume) and the porosity (RM_SetPorosity). The cell saturation returned by RM_GetSaturation may be less than or greater than the saturation set by the transport code (RM_SetSaturation), and may be greater than or less than 1.0, even in fully saturated simulations. Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information needed to accurately calculate solution volume and saturation: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.

Concentrations may be a mixture of two solutions, boundary_solution1 and boundary_solution2, with a mixing fraction for boundary_solution1 1 of fraction1 and mixing fraction for boundary_solution2 of (1 - fraction1). A negative value for boundary_solution2 implies no mixing, and the associated value for fraction1 is ignored.

"""
Transfer solutions and reactants from the InitialPhreeqc instance to the reaction-module workers, possibly with mixing. In its simplest form, initial_conditions1 is used to select initial conditions, including solutions and reactants, for each cell of the model, without mixing. Initial_conditions1 is dimensioned (nxyz, 7), where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount). The dimension of 7 refers to solutions and reactants in the following order: (1) SOLUTIONS, (2) EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, (3) EXCHANGE, (4) SURFACE, (5) GAS_PHASE, (6) SOLID_SOLUTIONS, and (7) KINETICS. In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, indicates that cell 99 (0 based) contains the SURFACE definition with user number 2 that has been defined in the InitialPhreeqc instance (either by RM_RunFile or RM_RunString).

It is also possible to mix solutions and reactants to obtain the initial conditions for cells. For mixing, initials_conditions2 contains numbers for a second entity that mixes with the entity defined in initial_conditions1. Fraction1 contains the mixing fraction for initial_conditions1, whereas (1 - fraction1) is the mixing fraction for initial_conditions2. In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, initial_solution2[3*nxyz + 99] = 3, fraction1[3*nxyz + 99] = 0.25 indicates that cell 99 (0 based) contains a mixture of 0.25 SURFACE 2 and 0.75 SURFACE 3, where the surface compositions have been defined in the InitialPhreeqc instance. If the user number in initial_conditions2 is negative, no mixing occurs. If initials_conditions2 and fraction1 are NULL, no mixing is used, and initial conditions are derived solely from initials_conditions1.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
initial_conditions1	Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. Negative values are ignored, resulting in no definition of that entity for that cell.
initial_conditions2	Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Nonnegative values of initial_conditions2 result in mixing with the entities defined in initial_conditions1. Negative values result in no mixing. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. May be NULL in C; setting to NULL results in no mixing.
fraction1	Fraction of initial_conditions1 that mixes with (1-fraction1) of initial_conditions2. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. May be NULL in C; setting to NULL results in no mixing.
Return values
IRM_RESULT	0 is success, negative is failure (See RM_DecodeError).

"""
Fills an array (species_c) with aqueous species concentrations from solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. This method is intended for use with multicomponent-diffusion transport calculations, and RM_SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to true. The method is used to obtain aqueous species concentrations for boundary conditions. If a negative value is used for a cell in boundary_solution1, then the highest numbered solution in the InitialPhreeqc instance will be used for that cell. Concentrations may be a mixture of two solutions, boundary_solution1 and boundary_solution2, with a mixing fraction for boundary_solution1 1 of fraction1 and mixing fraction for boundary_solution2 of (1 - fraction1). A negative value for boundary_solution2 implies no mixing, and the associated value for fraction1 is ignored. If boundary_solution2 and fraction1 are NULL, no mixing is used; concentrations are derived from boundary_solution1 only.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
species_c	Array of aqueous concentrations extracted from the InitialPhreeqc instance. The dimension of species_c is equivalent to Fortran allocation (n_boundary, nspecies), where nspecies is the number of aqueous species returned from RM_GetSpeciesCount.
n_boundary	The number of boundary condition solutions that need to be filled.
boundary_solution1	Array of solution index numbers that refer to solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Size is n_boundary.
boundary_solution2	Array of solution index numbers that that refer to solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance and are defined to mix with boundary_solution1. Size is n_boundary. May be NULL in C.
fraction1	Fraction of boundary_solution1 that mixes with (1-fraction1) of boundary_solution2. Size is n_boundary. May be NULL in C.

MPI only. Workers (processes with RM_GetMpiMyself > 0) must call RM_MpiWorker to be able to respond to messages from the root to accept data, perform calculations, and (or) return data. RM_MpiWorker contains a loop that reads a message from root, performs a task, and waits for another message from root. RM_SetConcentrations, RM_RunCells, and RM_GetConcentrations are examples of methods that send a message from root to get the workers to perform a task. The workers will respond to all methods that are designated "workers must be in the loop of RM_MpiWorker" in the MPI section of the method documentation. The workers will continue to respond to messages from root until root calls RM_MpiWorkerBreak.

(Advanced) The list of tasks that the workers perform can be extended by using RM_SetMpiWorkerCallback. It is then possible to use the MPI processes to perform other developer-defined tasks, such as transport calculations, without exiting from the RM_MpiWorker loop. Alternatively, root calls RM_MpiWorkerBreak to allow the workers to continue past a call to RM_MpiWorker. The workers perform developer-defined calculations, and then RM_MpiWorker is called again to respond to requests from root to perform reaction-module tasks.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.

"""
Sets the property for partitioning solids between the saturated and unsaturated parts of a partially saturated cell.

The option is intended to be used by saturated-only flow codes that allow a variable water table. The value has meaning only when saturations less than 1.0 are encountered. The partially saturated cells may have a small water-to-rock ratio that causes reactions to proceed differently relative to fully saturated cells. By setting RM_SetPartitionUZSolids to true, the amounts of solids and gases are partioned according to the saturation. If a cell has a saturation of 0.5, then the water interacts with only half of the solids and gases; the other half is unreactive until the water table rises. As the saturation in a cell varies, solids and gases are transferred between the saturated and unsaturated (unreactive) reservoirs of the cell. Unsaturated-zone flow and transport codes will probably use the default (false), which assumes all gases and solids are reactive regardless of saturation.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
tf	True, the fraction of solids and gases available for reaction is equal to the saturation; False (default), all solids and gases are reactive regardless of saturation.

Setting to enable or disable printing detailed output from reaction calculations to the output file for a set of cells defined by RM_SetPrintChemistryMask. The detailed output prints all of the output typical of a PHREEQC reaction calculation, which includes solution descriptions and the compositions of all other reactants. The output can be several hundred lines per cell, which can lead to a very large output file (prefix.chem.txt, RM_OpenFiles). For the worker instances, the output can be limited to a set of cells (RM_SetPrintChemistryMask) and, in general, the amount of information printed can be limited by use of options in the PRINT data block of PHREEQC (applied by using RM_RunFile or RM_RunString). Printing the detailed output for the workers is generally used only for debugging, and PhreeqcRM will run significantly faster when printing detailed output for the workers is disabled.

"""
Set the representative volume of each reaction cell. By default the representative volume of each reaction cell is 1 liter. The volume of water in a reaction cell is determined by the procuct of the representative volume, the porosity (RM_SetPorosity), and the saturation (RM_SetSaturation). The numerical method of PHREEQC is more robust if the water volume for a reaction cell is within a couple orders of magnitude of 1.0. Small water volumes caused by small porosities and (or) small saturations (and (or) small representative volumes) may cause non-convergence of the numerical method. In these cases, a larger representative volume may help. Note that increasing the representative volume also increases the number of moles of the reactants in the reaction cell (minerals, surfaces, exchangers, and others), which are defined as moles per representative volume.

Parameters

If a single SOLID_SOLUTION definition is used for cells with different initial porosity, the three options scale quite differently. For option 0, the number of moles of a solid-solution component will be the same regardless of porosity. For option 1, the number of moles of a solid-solution component will be vary directly with porosity and inversely with rock volume. For option 2, the number of moles of a solid-solution component will vary directly with rock volume and inversely with porosity.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
option	Units option for solid solutions: 0, 1, or 2.
Return values
IRM_RESULT	0 is success, negative is failure (See RM_DecodeError).

Set input units for surfaces. In PHREEQC input, surfaces are defined by moles of surface sites (Mp). RM_SetUnitsSurface specifies how the number of moles of surface sites in a reaction cell (Mc) is calculated from the input value (Mp).

Options are 0, Mp is mol/L of RV (default), Mc = Mp*RV, where RV is the representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume); 1, Mp is mol/L of water in the RV, Mc = Mp*P*RV, where P is porosity (RM_SetPorosity); or 2, Mp is mol/L of rock in the RV, Mc = Mp*(1-P).RV.

"""
Set solution concentrations in the reaction cells based on the vector of aqueous species concentrations (species_conc). This method is intended for use with multicomponent-diffusion transport calculations, and RM_SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to true. The list of aqueous species is determined by RM_FindComponents and includes all aqueous species that can be made from the set of components. The method determines the total concentration of a component by summing the molarities of the individual species times the stoichiometric coefficient of the element in each species. Solution compositions in the reaction cells are updated with these component concentrations.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
species_conc	Array of aqueous species concentrations. Dimension of the array is (nxyz, nspecies), where nxyz is the number of user grid cells (RM_GetGridCellCount), and nspecies is the number of aqueous species (RM_GetSpeciesCount). Concentrations are moles per liter.
Return values
IRM_RESULT	0 is success, negative is failure (See RM_DecodeError).

"""
Determines the volume and density to use when converting from the reaction-module concentrations to transport concentrations (RM_GetConcentrations). Two options are available to convert concentration units: (1) the density and solution volume calculated by PHREEQC are used, or (2) the specified density (RM_SetDensity) and solution volume are defined by the product of saturation (RM_SetSaturation), porosity (RM_SetPorosity), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume). Transport models that consider density-dependent flow will probably use the PHREEQC-calculated density and solution volume (default), whereas transport models that assume constant-density flow will probably use specified values of density and solution volume. Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information needed to accurately calculate density and solution volume: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat. Density is only used when converting to transport units of mass fraction.

Parameters
id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
tf	True indicates that the solution density and volume as calculated by PHREEQC will be used to calculate concentrations. False indicates that the solution density set by RM_SetDensity and the volume determined by the product of RM_SetSaturation, RM_SetPorosity, and RM_SetRepresentativeVolume, will be used to calculate concentrations retrieved by RM_GetConcentrations.
