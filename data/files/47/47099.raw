# Client logic deals with handling control frames, user requesting to send frames, state.
# The ClientLogic type is defined below entirely synchronously. It takes input via the `handle()`
# function, which is defined for the different input types below. It performs internal logic and
# produces a call to its outbound interface.
#
# The outbound interface is composed of two abstract types `AbstractHandlerTaskProxy` and
# `AbstractWriterTaskProxy`. The concrete implementations will be `TaskProxy` objects, which will
# store the calls (function and arguments) and call it on a target object in another coroutine. This
# means that as long as the channels don't block, the logic will be performed concurrently with the
# the callbacks and writing to the network. This is important because the logic might have to respond
# to ping requests in a timely manner, which it might not be able to do if the callbacks block.
#
# For testing purposes the abstract outbound interface can be replaced with mock objects. This lets us
# test the logic of the WebSocket synchronously, without any asynchronicity or concurrency
# complicating things.

# These types define the input interface for the client logic.
