"""
  Implements a pareto-based multiple-objective fitness scheme through the use
  of Goldberg fitness ranking, wherein individuals are assigned a rank based
  upon the number of individuals by whom they are dominated, as given by
  the formula:

    Rank(i) = 1 + DominatedBy(i)

  **Parameters:**
  `of:Type` - the base fitness type (default is Float).
  `maximise:Bool` - a flag, indicating whether fitness values are to be
    maximised or minimised.
