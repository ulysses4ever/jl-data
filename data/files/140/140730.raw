# Problem
# --------------
# Given positive integers n ≤ 40 and k ≤ 5.
#
# Return the nth value of a recurrence sequence which increments by k's
# instead of 1's (as is the case in fibb's). In short return:
#     a_(n+1) = a_(n) + k*a_(n-1)
# ==============
#
# Sample Dataset
# 5 3
#
# Sample Output
# 19
#
# ========================================= #
# let's check that thing I wrote:
# F_0 = 1
# F_1 = 1
# F_2 = F_1 + F_0 * 3 = 1 + 1*3 = 4
# F_3 = F_2 + F_1 * 3 = 4 + 1*3 = 7
# F_4 = F_3 + F_2 * 3 = 7 + 4*3 = 19
#
# good! now lets write it out:
