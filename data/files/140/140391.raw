#### CONTACT NETWORK from social network

#! contact; else both do not contact. Return the network 2D array.

#### DISTANCES
#!calculate distances between fish and fishermen? + search/steam switch

#### INFORMATION and fisher direction
#! Iterate through the people you share information with and get the locations

#! (KK) whether or not you caught something (?)
