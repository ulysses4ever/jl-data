Demonstrates the usage of a Continuous.LimPID controller


This is a simple drive train controlled by a PID controller:

* The two blocks "kinematic_PTP" and "integrator" are used to generate
  the reference speed (= constant acceleration phase, constant speed
  phase, constant deceleration phase until inertia is at rest). To
  check whether the system starts in steady state, the reference speed
  is zero until time = 0.5 s and then follows the sketched
  trajectory. Note: the "kinematic_PTP" isn't used; that comment is
  based on the Modelica model.

* The block "PI" is an instance of "LimPID" which is a PID controller
  where several practical important aspects, such as
  anti-windup-compensation has been added. In this case, the control
  block is used as PI controller.

* The output of the controller is a torque that drives a motor inertia
  "inertia1". Via a compliant spring/damper component, the load
  inertia "inertia2" is attached. A constant external torque of 10 Nm
  is acting on the load inertia.
