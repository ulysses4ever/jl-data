# A device model is a function that returns a list of equations or
# other devices that also return lists of equations. The equations
# each are assumed equal to zero. So,
#    der(y) = x + 1
# Should be entered as:
#    der(y) - (x+1)

"""
The Van Der Pol oscillator is a simple problem with two equations
and two unknowns.
