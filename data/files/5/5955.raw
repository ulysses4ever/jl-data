# there could be a case to make one function that takes both positive and negative
# integers for the distance. R does this with lag(). But it's not intuitive.


function lead(x, n:Int64)

# return an object that pads NAs at the end relative the lead integer value

end


function lag(x, n:Int64)

# return an object that pads NAs at the beginning relative the lag integer value

end
