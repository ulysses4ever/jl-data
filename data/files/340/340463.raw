### Auxiliary functions used as scores for penalising deviation of observed from target acceptance rate

## logistic_rate_score

# logistic_rate_score uses the logistic function to scale the acceptance rate by a factor ranging from 0 to 2
# In other words, it allows to nearly eliminate or double the rate depending on its observed value
# k gives the curve's steepness. For larger k, the curve becomes more steep

logistic_rate_score(x::Real, k::Real=7.) = logistic(x, 2., k, 0., 0.)

## erf_rate_score

# erf_rate_score uses the error function (erf) to scale the acceptance rate by a factor ranging from 0 to 2
# In other words, it allows to nearly eliminate or double the rate depending on its observed value
# k gives the curve's steepness. For larger k, the curve becomes more steep

erf_rate_score(x::Real, k::Real=3.) = erf(k*x)+1

### AcceptanceRateMCTune

# AcceptanceRateMCTune holds the tuning-related local variables of a MCSampler that uses the AcceptanceRateMCTuner

type AcceptanceRateMCTune <: MCTunerState
  step::Real # Stepsize of MCMC iteration (for ex leapfrog in HMC or drift stepsize in MALA)
  accepted::Int # Number of accepted MCMC samples during current tuning period
  proposed::Int # Number of proposed MCMC samples during current tuning period
  rate::Real # Observed acceptance rate over current tuning period

### AcceptanceRateMCTuner

# AcceptanceRateMCTuner tunes empirically on the basis of the discrepancy between observed and target acceptance rate
# This discrepancy is pernalised via a score function set by the user
# The default score function is a stretched logistic map

    @assert 0 < targetrate < 1 "Target acceptance rate should be between 0 and 1"
    @assert period > 0 "Tuning period should be positive"
