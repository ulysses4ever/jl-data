{"description": "Besides great software engineers, we are looking for \"foundation\" hires. Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we\u2019re a remote team and a service company, and you\u2019ll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done\u2014or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either. For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners. It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. We've worked really hard over the last four years to earn our little \"bubble\" of autonomy, and it takes a concerted team effort to maintain and expand that bubble. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is). Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it. As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help a new-ish, growth company reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that.

{"description": "Rails: Mastery Implementing payments is no walk in the park. This isn't some social network where a teenager might throw a fit if their status update doesn't get posted. > When a payments service goes down, real people lose real money. One thing's for sure .. this is NOT for the faint of heart. Technical Challenges There aren't alot of places that offer the technical challenges a payments startup can. As the CTO, you're at the helm of it all .. you're in the drivers seat. If this doesn't get you worked up, I don't know what will. Here are the highlights: 100% uptime. For most startups, scheduling downtime is no biggie. Not with payments. That means all sorts of complications .. how do you migrate your DB schema without downtime? How do you keep everything working while pushing updates to the production app? Needless to say, some DevOps experience is going to be crucial. Bits = $s . There's a ton of moving parts in a payments solution. And data integrity is key. The last thing you want is for a customer to get charged, and the DB not reflecting it for whatever reason. Or off-by-one errors. The values you see on the screen are real $ .. maintaining data integrity and consistency will be crucial. Frequently Asked Questions (No one asked, I just made these up) Must I have payments experience to apply? Nah.. It's alright if you don't have direct experience working with payments, but experience in other areas where some of these challenges exist would be great. I don't deal well with stress, should I still apply? No, don't. This ain't no walk in the park. There's no cushion between you and reality. You'll be working on real problems for real people .. and dealing with real money. When something goes wrong, no one's going to be insulating you from reality. How far along are you? Well, so far I've been able to build an MVP. Essentially, it's a bunch of lines that -- when put together -- process payments more often than it breaks down. This includes an API , a barren dashboard and the payment engine (that processes the $). We're processing ~$10K from a handful of merchants, with about 400 merchants on our waiting list that we're inviting individually (we don't want to bring them on board just yet in case everything comes falling apart). Why payments? I'm a developer -- and I've tried building online products for as long as I remember (I didn't play outside much when I was a kid). It's just really hard to get paid when you're not born in the US. Important Note: Show, don't tell. I don't really care how long you've been using Ruby/Rails. It's what you've built that matters. You could've just started 6 months ago, but've if you've built some amazing projects -- that'll weigh alot more in my book than someone who's been reading Rails books for decades and can talk for hours about the different forms of data binding.", "tags": ["ruby-on-rails", "ruby", "node.js", "payment-processing"], "url": "http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/73065/the-wizard-of-rails-white-inc?a=ovem8jRpcnm", "title": "The Wizard of Rails", "employer": "White Inc.", "location": ["Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "date": "2014-11-25T11:31:59.818866", "id": "73065"}

{"description": "Bluebeam Software makes smart, simple solutions for paperless workflows that leverage the PDF format. It all started way back in 1997, when we developed CAD to PDF creation technology for aerospace engineers. Now our award-winning PDF creation, markup and editing solutions are used by the world's top architecture, engineering and construction firms, as well as government agencies. We also have a strong following among tablet PC users, students and educators, accountants and even lawyers. Go Figure! When it comes to developing innovative products, our philosophy is quite simple. We don't just create \"easy-to-use\" software, we design ways that make our software feel like second-nature. So, we're relentlessly working to mimic the way you normally work with pen and paper. We also avoid complex jargon and \"corporatey\" policies like the plague. In fact, we're confident you'll find Bluebeam to be a breath of fresh air, and appreciate that our people do everything they can to lend you a helping hand. Speaking of Bluebeam employees, we're one big group of corporate misfits, and proud of it! We refuse to be confined by preconceived notions of what PDF software can and should do. We like to shake things up, tear 'em apart and make them our own. Or, completely ignore what others have done and make our own path. Our employees come from diverse technical and artistic backgrounds, and we've even been known to convert Bluebeam users into Bluebeam employees. If you like to work hard, make a real impact and have a good time in the process, there just might be a place for you on our team.

We also have a strong following among tablet PC users, students and educators, accountants and even lawyers. Go Figure! When it comes to developing innovative products, our philosophy is quite simple. We don't just create \"easy-to-use\" software, we design ways that make our software feel like second-nature. So, we're relentlessly working to mimic the way you normally work with pen and paper. We also avoid complex jargon and \"corporatey\" policies like the plague. In fact, we're confident you'll find Bluebeam to be a breath of fresh air, and appreciate that our people do everything they can to lend you a helping hand. Speaking of Bluebeam employees, we're one big group of corporate misfits, and proud of it! We refuse to be confined by preconceived notions of what PDF software can and should do. We like to shake things up, tear 'em apart and make them our own. Or, completely ignore what others have done and make our own path.

Building the Platform In 2000, Amazon.com began to offer its best-of-breed e-commerce platform to other retailers and to individual sellers. Now, big-name retailers work with Amazon Services to power their e-commerce offerings from end-to-end, including technology services, merchandising, customer service, and order fulfillment.

Finally, independent software developers also derive value from the platform--through Amazon Web Services--by building profitable applications and services that cater to Amazon.com customers and sellers. We've Only Just Begun This evolution of Amazon.com from Web site to e-commerce partner to development platform is driven by the spirit of innovation that is part of the company's DNA.

{"description": "Our Ideal Candidate: Is someone who's worked in an Agile engineering team before at a small startup where you also developed a couple solid applications using Ruby on Rails and other MVC frameworks. You come at issues from a product standpoint, and you get excited about product, company and business challenges. We're especially looking for engineers who can demonstrate aptitude in the following skills: * Real tech fluency: You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 3+ years of software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. * Communication skills: You aren't just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. * Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how the product you're building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems. * Self-Directed: Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn't have QA, project managers or product managers so we take ownership of what we build. * Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog. * Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if we think you're funny or if you're already a car enthusiast! Bonus Points For: * Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Google Hangouts and Pivotal to get stuff done. We're agnostic about what you've used (and no judging if you're more into BitBucket) and are more interested in the process you like to use. * Experience working with testing and continuous integration.

The Remedy Partners solution empowers health care providers to develop and operate patient-centric episode of care payment programs leading to improved clinical outcomes, lower costs and increased patient satisfaction. Remedy and its provider partners achieve these results through a combination of enhanced financial incentives, sophisticated analytics and healthcare intelligence, a robust technology and communications platform, and collaborative relationships with participating providers. We believe that successful Episode Programs require a high level of cooperation between providers, outstanding technologies to link providers and patients, risk management systems that limit downside in taking episode risk, superior data analytics capabilities to measure and track care and performance, and financial management systems to manage claims and accurately report results. Remedy focuses on each of these challenges and develops solutions that allow our care teams to succeed. The challenges of successfully managing episodes of care are made easier by our proprietary tool, Episode Connect, which vastly improves our ability to gather and analyze information and make it available to providers and patients.\u00a0 Episode Connect is a robust technology platform that enables the sharing of information and coordination of care under a bundled payment arrangement. The Remedy Episode Connect platform combines leading analytics and communication technologies to ensure the most up to date information is available to all stakeholders involved in the treatment of a patient.

Today, the Foundation has over 90 full-time employees. Core to our philosophy is how we think of our capital and its risk profile relative to other stakeholders in the drug development pipeline. We work aggressively to de-risk various treatment ideas and tools in the hopes of building a robust pipeline of new treatments for patients.\u00a0 In order to achieve our mission of finding a cure for PD it is critical that we engage with, and bring together, members of the PD community including researchers, physicians, health professionals and most important, people with Parkinson's and their families. We believe that raising the Foundation\u2019s profile with a broader audience online will help us more efficiently reach and mobilize highly engaged stakeholders who are more likely to feel personally vested in helping speed progress toward a cure.

{"description": "Besides great software engineers, we are looking for \"foundation\" hires. Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we\u2019re a remote team and a service company, and you\u2019ll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done\u2014or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either. For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners. It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. We've worked really hard over the last four years to earn our little \"bubble\" of autonomy, and it takes a concerted team effort to maintain and expand that bubble. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is). Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it. As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help a new-ish, growth company reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that.

The Braintree full-stack payment platform lets companies build their own experiences and then scale their businesses around the globe. We're known for our technology but we're also known for our support, with internal risk and underwriting, account management and technical support teams who ensure a frictionless payments experience. Our technology fuels companies like GitHub, 37Signals, Uber, Airbnb, OpenTable, Heroku and more. Recently acquired by PayPal, Braintree is now in an even greater position to change the way people pay. The team recently launched v.zero, a new SDK that enables processing of all payment instruments and platforms in a single code path. Headquartered in Chicago, Braintree has offices in San Francisco, New York, Sydney, London with employees stationed around the world. Our software development team has serious developer cred and folks have noticed: FastCo Labs Braintree is growing the team and looking for Front End Developers.\u00a0 Candidates for this role should have experience working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and be familiar with web application frameworks (e.g. Rails or Sinatra).\u00a0 Candidates should have an insatiable passion for building amazing applications that customers love to use and leveraging metrics to determine the success of their applications. Instead of including a list of requirements we want you to understand how we work. How we work We are polyglots... Although most of our software is written in Ruby, we don\u2019t confine ourselves to a single programming language. We believe in using the best tool for the job while maintaining a slight bias toward the tools the team knows the best. We\u2019ve written infrastructure components in Python, and we build client libraries for integrating with Braintree in Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP, Java, and .NET. We pair... We pair program. We work on Mac Pros with two keyboards and dual 27\" cinema displays. We work in an open team room; no cubicles or private offices. Communication is key to our process, and we don't want to hinder it with walls. We test... Testing is at the forefront of our development philosophy. We never need to check our code coverage to know that it's at 100%: with disciplined TDD, no line of code will be written without a test. We're confident that our automated testing is thorough and will catch any regression bugs - and that\u2019s critical given the software we write!\u00a0 We use continuous integration to test every version of every client library against our gateway. We are agile... Agile development methodologies mean different things to different people. For us, the most important part of Agile is doing what works best for the team. We have a story card wall and release a few times a week. We keep the team in sync with daily standups and have a retrospective once a month to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements. We\u2019re pragmatic, not dogmatic. Although we have strong opinions, we're never afraid to try to new things to see if they work and reconsider our positions if the situation warrants it.

{"description": "The Ceros platform empowers designers and marketers to create and publish beautiful, interactive content experiences without the need for developers. Our users work collaboratively in real-time on a browser-based digital canvas to create pixel-perfect experiences with rich animations and interactivity. The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code. About the Product Designing and building the Ceros platform is no easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what\u2019s currently possible. Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element. We\u2019re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, MySQL, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud. About the Team As part of the Ceros product team, you\u2019ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you\u2019ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward. We have a very dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren\u2019t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it\u2019s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO\u2019s atroshus spelling. About the Job Working completely from home, you\u2019ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15\u201d Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.). As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves: writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying), having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write, carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards, agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product, and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it. Next Steps If you\u2019re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We\u2019re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don\u2019t be afraid to express yourself.", "tags": ["jquery", "php", "oop", "chef", "javascript"], "url": "http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/52501/full-stack-engineer-100-remote-ceros?a=hBE6s6yd9bW", "title": "Full Stack Engineer - 100% Remote", "employer": "Ceros", "location": ["New York", "NY"], "date": "2014-11-25T11:31:59.818866", "id": "52501"}

Speaking of Bluebeam employees, we're one big group of corporate misfits, and proud of it! We refuse to be confined by preconceived notions of what PDF software can and should do.

{"description": "SOLVE A $20 TRILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM There is over $20 trillion dollars in residential real estate in the US alone, but the data and tools available to professional builders, investors, and appraisers to help them understand the market are lacking when compared to other fields. In addition, real estate decision-making is only getting more complex, driven by: - Increasing price volatility - Increasing variance in price shifts between markets - Macro transitions in demographics and wealth - Abnormally low/potentially rising interest rates - A shifting financing landscape driven by the last recession HouseCanary is here to help. We empower our clients to make better real estate decisions by providing products that leverage the best real estate forecasts, data, and visualization tools around - ours. Whether it is providing a detailed assessment of the drivers of value in the San Antonio real estate market, valuing a pool of mortgages better than anyone else in the world, or building an app to help appraisers work twice as fast, we are where our clients need us most. How do you value 130 million homes? What will each of these homes be worth in three years? Getting the best people together to find answers to questions like these is what we are all about. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK WITH US Play with massive amounts of data We track thousands of data elements every month, from national factors down to house level data. Together, we have built the most exhaustive proprietary dataset going back 40+ years. The data is analyzed to pinpoint the driving factors behind market change. Our databases are constantly expanding - great data is required for accurate forecasts. See the future Our platform uses big-data analytics to forecast real estate values at a local market level. Every month, we forecast 36+ months into the future. Our models predict more than 95% of the variation in price over time, and have been market tested. We're constantly evolving our methods for even greater accuracy. Build great products What use is great data if it isn't easy to access and digest? We leverage technology to build great products.

Some of us have been doing software development for more than 20 years. The development team uses a mix of practices from XP, Agile and other methods like Planning Games, Sustainable Pace, Retrospectives, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Static Code Analysis, Code Reviews, Automated Acceptance and System Integration Testing, Contextual Design, Refactoring, Test-Driven Design, and Pair Programming. What we like We prefer people who think critically for themselves and show initiative. We like people who can say \u201cI've made a mistake\u201d and actually learn from it. We strive for continuous improvement at any level (technology and practices). We like to experiment with new things, but we don't throw away what's good about what we have already done. We like people to take responsibility for things, and we are ready to give them as much responsibility as they can handle. We believe in pay based on value delivered, not on years of experience. We believe in code quality and object oriented design. We think that code is design. We think that ultimately, code quality and software engineering are the primary contributing factors to cost efficiency. We like to learn new things, and we don't give up when we want to improve something but a solution is not obvious. We like to develop our own frameworks, but we are willing to get rid of them when we find a more viable solution in the FOSS world. From time to time we also like to contribute back FOSS code. We believe in collaboration and adaptation. We know that things change, and plans age very soon, but continuous planning is the key. What we don't like We don't do long meetings. We don't like overhead and inefficiencies. We hate bureaucracies and office politics. We hate to spend time on manual tasks that can be automated. We can't stand consciously reckless or incompetent behaviour. We know that multitasking is detrimental to our productivity and we avoid it as much as possible.

{"description": "Required 2+ years of professional Ruby programming experience. Ruby on Rails (3.2) - Models, views, controllers, the whole shebang. Javascript, HTML and CSS as well of course. Our reports utilize Highcharts, our trading system and customer dashboard are AJAX dependent . W e have no current plan to migrate to 4, but if you've done it and think there is a super compelling reason we are open to it. We are all about simple, clean code. As much fun as it is to mess with the future version of ourselves, we try to keep Ruby metacode magic to a bare minimum. Some SQL - We use Active Record, but making sure you are getting all the data you need for a report in as few calls as possible requires some background with raw SQL. Git/Github - Fundamental for multiple developers on a single codebase. You don't need to be a guru, but this is definitely something you have used at work previously. Nice to Have Typescript - Currently used for the auction pages, helps keeps things organized and testable when it matters. Pretty simple superset of Javascript with types. Devops - We are on Heroku and in the process of adding New Relic. Any experience troubleshooting Rails deployments is a plus. Build Tools - Have a favorite test system? CI? We plan to address our tooling once the team is in place. Pivotal Tracker - What we use for planning and tracking feature development. It's not hard to learn if you haven't used it before. Could be Fun Websockets - Currently we use polling for our auctions, but there are drawbacks. Stop it, now you're just messing with me Erlang/Elixir - We have the core of a live trading platform sitting on the shelf that it might make sense to dust off if our trading platform outgrows RoR. Depending on the team we might choose to do this in Erlang or pick another technology that works better for the team.

{"description": "Our Company Noom is a New York-based health & wellness tech startup that uses mobile technology to help people lead healthier lives (22 million and counting!). \u00a0While other fitness companies just track, we coach. \u00a0We learn from the best research in nutrition, psychology and behavior modification and combine it with the latest tech to design next-generation health & wellness apps on Android and iOS. We\u2019ve built a strong foundation with hundreds of thousands of paying customers, a grant from the National Institutes of Health, $7M in Series A funding led by RRE Ventures and a team of 40 full-time Noomers -- 30 in our NYC headquarters and 10 in our foreign offices (Seoul and Berlin). Our Tech At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job. We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo. We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. Our Culture We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture , stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain\u2019s \u201cBest Places to Work in NYC 2013\u201d Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. \u00a0We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you\u2019ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. \u00a0So unlike most tech companies, you\u2019ll interact with a diverse network of people. \u00a0After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing. If you\u2019re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. \u00a0You\u2019ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you\u2019re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn. We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!). Our Products At Noom we tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. \u00a0We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition ( TechCrunch ) and fitness ( GigaOm ). \u00a0More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health & fitness application since 2012. It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. How, you ask? Great question! It has: * A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks & realtime motivational feedback; * The world\u2019s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users & instantly searchable; * Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools. * A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use * Many more features focused around guidance & motivation for our users Our Benefits If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel\u2019s dismay). \u00a0Because you\u2019ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it\u2019s important for you to know what\u2019s going on. We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). \u00a0We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke). Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k).

{"description": "Bluebeam Software makes smart, simple solutions for paperless workflows that leverage the PDF format. It all started way back in 1997, when we developed CAD to PDF creation technology for aerospace engineers. Now our award-winning PDF creation, markup and editing solutions are used by the world's top architecture, engineering and construction firms, as well as government agencies. We also have a strong following among tablet PC users, students and educators, accountants and even lawyers. Go Figure! When it comes to developing innovative products, our philosophy is quite simple. We don't just create \"easy-to-use\" software, we design ways that make our software feel like second-nature. So, we're relentlessly working to mimic the way you normally work with pen and paper. We also avoid complex jargon and \"corporatey\" policies like the plague. In fact, we're confident you'll find Bluebeam to be a breath of fresh air, and appreciate that our people do everything they can to lend you a helping hand. Speaking of Bluebeam employees, we're one big group of corporate misfits, and proud of it! We refuse to be confined by preconceived notions of what PDF software can and should do. We like to shake things up, tear 'em apart and make them our own. Or, completely ignore what others have done and make our own path. Our employees come from diverse technical and artistic backgrounds, and we've even been known to convert Bluebeam users into Bluebeam employees. If you like to work hard, make a real impact and have a good time in the process, there just might be a place for you on our team.
