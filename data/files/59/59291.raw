"""
The ordering of the parental instantiations in discrete networks follows the convention
defined in Decision Making Under Uncertainty.

Suppose a variable has three discrete parents. The first parental instantiation
assigns all parents to their first bin. The second will assign the first
parent (as defined in `parents`) to its second bin and the other parents
to their first bin. The sequence continues until all parents are instantiated
to their last bins.

This is a directly copy from Base.sub2ind but allows for passing a vector instead of separate items

Note that this does NOT check bounds
