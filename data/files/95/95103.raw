# Simple Least Squares fitting

The `CurveFit` module provides functions that
implement a few least squares approximations.

It is simple in an engineering sense. It simply
returns the coefficients and does not do 
any error analysis. 

It does, however, provide a simple and common interface
to the routines.

The package also includes nonlinear least squares fitting
using a Newton type algorithm

The fitting algorithms include

 * Straight lines
 * Polynomial fitting
 * Power laws
 * log laws
 * exp laws
 * Rational polynopmial fitting
 * A generic non-linear fitting algorithm
 * King's law (used in hotwire anemometry)
