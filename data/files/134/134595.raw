export gsl_min_test_interval






# This function tests for the convergence of the interval [x_lower, x_upper]
# with absolute error epsabs and relative error epsrel.  The test returns
# GSL_SUCCESS if the following condition is achieved,                 |a - b| <
# epsabs + epsrel min(|a|,|b|)  when the interval x = [a,b] does not include
# the origin.  If the interval includes the origin then \min(|a|,|b|) is
# replaced by zero (which is the minimum value of |x| over the interval).  This
# ensures that the relative error is accurately estimated for minima close to
# the origin.          This condition on the interval also implies that any
# estimate of the minimum x_m in the interval satisfies the same condition with
# respect to the true minimum x_m^*,                 |x_m - x_m^*| < epsabs +
# epsrel x_m^*  assuming that the true minimum x_m^* is contained within the
# interval.
# 
#   Returns: Cint
