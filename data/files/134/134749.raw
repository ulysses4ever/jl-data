# This function computes the numerical derivative of the function f at the
# point x using an adaptive central difference algorithm with a step-size of h.
# The derivative is returned in result and an estimate of its absolute error is
# returned in abserr.          The initial value of h is used to estimate an
# optimal step-size, based on the scaling of the truncation error and round-off
# error in the derivative calculation.  The derivative is computed using a
# 5-point rule for equally spaced abscissae at x-h, x-h/2, x, x+h/2, x+h, with
# an error estimate taken from the difference between the 5-point rule and the
# corresponding 3-point rule x-h, x, x+h.  Note that the value of the function
# at x does not contribute to the derivative calculation, so only 4-points are
# actually used.
# 
#   Returns: Cint

# This function computes the numerical derivative of the function f at the
# point x using an adaptive forward difference algorithm with a step-size of h.
# The function is evaluated only at points greater than x, and never at x
# itself.  The derivative is returned in result and an estimate of its absolute
# error is returned in abserr.  This function should be used if f(x) has a
# discontinuity at x, or is undefined for values less than x.          The
# initial value of h is used to estimate an optimal step-size, based on the
# scaling of the truncation error and round-off error in the derivative
# calculation.  The derivative at x is computed using an “open” 4-point rule
# for equally spaced abscissae at x+h/4, x+h/2, x+3h/4, x+h, with an error
# estimate taken from the difference between the 4-point rule and the
# corresponding 2-point rule x+h/2, x+h.

# This function computes the numerical derivative of the function f at the

# discontinuity at x, or is undefined for values greater than x.          This
# function is equivalent to calling gsl_deriv_forward with a negative step-
# size.
