## and then splits that list of ID numbers into the number of splits passed
## as the parameter
## Cretes text files containing the Kepler IDs for each group


## This function takes a file that contains the Kepler IDs to be grouped
## And then creates a text file that contains the full path for each file
## for each of the assigned Kepler IDs 
## It also creates a text file that contains the full path for only
## the first file that is for a specific ID


# At some point use cp(source,destination) to copy files
