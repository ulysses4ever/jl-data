#========================== The Qubit DataType ================================#
# For the purposes of this code, the only info needed about a qubit is its
# resonant frequency relative to the local oscillator, which boards/lines
# are able to communicate with it, and the on-board data for gates.

# Depending on if lines permit, we can control our qubits with only XY control
# or with full XYZ.  If the Z line is absent, the underlying type is a QubitNoZ,
# and if present it is a QubitWithZ.  The user only creates "Qubit" objects,
# and depending on whether a Z line is specified, the program generates the
# proper concrete type.

# ================= Initializing a Qubit's information ========================#

# or omit it entirely.

# different pulse shapes, so we provide quick ways to make gaussian-envelope and
# cos-envelope pulses.  These are all FloatWaveform objects with all the
# assumptions mentioned above.  We also provide a generalInit function that
# takes a shape for the window, though it must be floatIdleLength points exactly
# or an error will be thrown down the line.

# These functions assume that half-amplitude pulses provide half the rotation.
# This is a good starting point but is not accurate for high-fidelity gates.

# The XY and Z arguments specify whether the pulses created are for the XY
# control or the Z control.  By default, both are on, but it is likely the
# ideal amplitude for each is different.  For QubitNoZ objects, setting Z to
# true or false makes no difference.
