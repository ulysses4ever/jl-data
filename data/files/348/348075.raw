# Clifford module

# This module contains code for generating sequences of clifford gates.  The
# exported functions benchmark1Qubit and benchmark2Qubit generate sequences
# equivalent to an idle gate for one qubit, and to either an idle or swap for
# two qubits.  Additional arguments allow for restricting the control sequences
# to only XY control and for interleaved random benchmarking of a specific gate.



#============= Matrices =============#

# Mathematical background for using integers mod 5 instead of complexes:

# 2^n x 2^n Clifford matrices can be normalized to have all entries one of
# {0, +1, -1, +i, -i}, and the first nonzero entry in the first row may always
# be 1.  This is a 5-element set closed under multiplication, so we can just use
# the 5-element field. Explicitly: 0 <=> 0, 1 <=> 1, -1 <=> 4, i <=> 2, -i <=> 3
# respects element multiplication.  Matrix multiplication involves addition as
# well, and while 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + i is not -i.  However, under the normalization
# convention above, the entire matrix is divided by the first nonzero entry, or
# equivalently multiplied by its inverse.  Thus, one need only verify that all
# encodings of {1,2,3,4} with magnitudes sqrt(2)^k for integer k have the same
# angular orientation (that is, they read 1, 2, 4, 3 taken clockwise).  This
# may be easily proven graphically, showing that this isomorphism is sound.

# The clifford matrix is 2^2n elements and all are part of the 5-element field,
# so in principle an enitre 4x4 matrix is one UInt64's worth of information.
# In practice, that kind of bit twiddling is likely slower than machine
# vectorized integer operations, so instead we will just use matrices
# of UInt8s, taking things mod 5 at the end of a calculation.

#============= Pulses =============#

# We need an understandable way to designate the gates, so that control lines
# can quickly convert between this program's output and pulse sequencing.  A
# pulse matrix has each column a different qubit, and each row a different time
# step.  Functions closer to the instruments will convert the entries for a
# specific qubit into microwave control pulses, while it is the responsibility
# of the higher-up code to ensure that the requested pulses are all timed
# appropriately.

# Initially Pulse was simply a typealias to Matrix{Int8}, but I wanted to treat
# Pulses differently in some special cases for dispatch.  The definitions below
# are sufficient to allow Julia to treat Pulse objects identically to Matrices
# for indexing and concatenation, and show Pulses nicely with named gates.  It
# also allows one to specify a sequence with one pulse repeated many times, for
# example [Xpi; Idle*10; Ypi] for a pause between Xpi and Ypi of 10 Idle gates.
