#	Desc:		If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
#				of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.The sum of these multiples is
#				23.
#
#				Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

lower = 1
upper = 1000
cumulative_sum = 0

for x in lower:upper-1
	if mod(x, 3) == 0 || mod(x, 5) == 0	# div. by 3
		cumulative_sum += x
	end
end

println("The cumulative sum is:\t$cumulative_sum")
