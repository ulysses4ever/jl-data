Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

=#

module
  function sum_even_fib(num)
    sum = 0
    prevnum = 1
    currentnum = 1
    if num == 1
      return 0
    end

    while currentnum < num
      if currentnum % 2 == 0
        sum += currentnum
      end
      temp = currentnum
      currentnum += prevnum
      prevnum = temp
    end
    return sum
  end
end

sum_even_fib(4000000)
