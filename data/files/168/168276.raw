# TODO: Add a tabu walk that looks at its own history, possibly only as far back as when it got to a certain level of fitness, and doesn't revisit nodes.
# TODO: Add an optional limit on walk length.
# TODO: Another tabu strategy is to avoid mutating a given locus more than once every k iterations.
# TODO: Consider optionally doing a depth-first search with backtracking to ensure total exploration of a plateau before declaring it a local optimum.

@doc """A record of the path of an adaptive or random walk.

`strategy` - Can be one of :natural, :random, :greedy, :reluctant,
:fitness_range, :fitter_then_neutral for now.

`length` - The number of transitions from the original genotype to the ultimate
optimum. This will be one less than the width of the `history_list` matrix.

`history_list` - Array of genotypes found along the path from the original to
the optimum. Each genotype is stored in a column.

`history_set` - Dictionary of genotypes found along the path from the original
to the optimum. Used in plateau search to avoid repeated states

`fitnesses` - Vector of fitnesses of the genotype visited along the path to the
optimum. The ith fitness corresponds to the ith column in the `history_list`
matrix.
