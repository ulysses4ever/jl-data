# Benchmark a set of optimizers on a set of problems.
# Returns: The data profiles for each of the optimizers on the problems. Each 
# data profile uses three performance measures: time, function evaluations and
# iterations (since we always use an optimizer in iterations with one call to
# ask(opt) and one call to tell(opt) for each iteration).
# Both of the first two are relevant and all three can be easily collected 
# during optimization. The number of iterations is not so critical to evaluate
# the overall performance of an optimizer, it is more of an internal measure.
# Still it gives an indication of how well an optimizer can be "stepped" and thus
# how flexibly we can use it in more elaborate/complex optimization schemes.
function benchmark(optimizers, problems)

  # We will collect a dict of dicts that map a problem to an opt to the performance
  # trace for that opt on that problem.
  profiles = Dict(Any, Any)

  # For each problem, run all the optimizers while collecting a quality profile.
  # Shuffle the order of the problems just in case they have some dependence.
  for(p in shuffle(problems))

    # Create the dict mapping opts to their performance trace on this problem.
    profiles[p] = Dict(Any, Any)

    # Shuffle the order of the optimizers for this problem (in case there is 
    # some state/dependence between calls to a problem).
    for(opt in shuffle(optimizers))
