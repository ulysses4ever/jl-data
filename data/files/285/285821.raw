# COMPUTE WEIGHTED RESIDUALS (Y - 1/2 - diag(W)XB) IN LOGISTIC REGRESSION
# This subroutine, in contrast to the previous update_residuals!() function, 
# will compute WEIGHTED residuals in ONE pass.
# For optimal performance, feed it a precomputed vector of x*b.
# This variant accepts a BEDFile object for the argument x.
# 
# Arguments:
# -- r is the preallocated vector of n residuals to overwrite.
# -- x is the BEDFile that contains the compressed n x p design matrix.
# -- y is the n-vector of responses.
# -- b is the p-vector of effect sizes.
# -- perm is the p-vector that indexes b.
# -- w is the n-vector of residual weights.
#
# Optional Arguments:
# -- Xb is the n-vector x*b of predicted responses.
#    If X*b is precomputed, then this function will compute the residuals much more quickly.
# -- n is the number of samples. Defaults to length(y).
# -- p is the number of predictors. Defaults to length(b).
