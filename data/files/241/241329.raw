# Betweenness centrality measures
# TODO - weighted, separate unweighted, edge betweenness


@doc """ Betweenness centrality

\$bc(v) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}}
        \sum_{s \neq t \neq v} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}\$


## Parameters

g: AbstractGraph
    A Graph, directed or undirected.

weights: AbstractArray{Float64, 2}, optional
    Matrix containing the weight associated with each edge (i,j)
    `ω[i, j]` is the weight between vertices `i` and `j`.
    If no weights are specified, shortest paths are computed using equal
    weights. If values are missing, they are assumed equal to `1`.
    *Advice* Use sparse matrices for better performances.

k: Integer, optional
    Use `k` nodes sample to estimate the betweenness centrality. If none,
    betweenness centrality is computed using the `n` nodes in the graph.

normalize: bool, optional
    If true, the betweenness values are normalized by the total number
    of possible distinct paths between all pairs in the graphs. For an undirected graph,
    this number if `((n-1)*(n-2))/2` and for a directed graph, `(n-1)*(n-2)`
    where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

endpoints: bool, optional
    If true, endpoints are included in the shortest path count.

## Returns

betweenness: Array{Float64}
    Betweenness centrality value per node id.
