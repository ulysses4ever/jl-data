module MCTS
# This module implements Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), an online MDP solver.
#It is adapted by <zouhair> from code available @ https://bitbucket.org/sisl/mdp.jl/


# In MCTS. the poosible evolutions of the system are represented as a tree
# and an approximation to this tree is built iteratively and used to inform the choice of action.
#Documentation for MCTS can be found in Decision Making Under Uncertainty, MIT Press 2015,
#and A survey of Monte Carlo tree search methods in Computational Intelligence and AI in games, 2012.
