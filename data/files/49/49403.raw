A **very** experimental label propagation method for probabilistic networks

This function is a take on the usual LP method for community detection. Instead
of updating labels by taking the most frequent in the neighbors, this algorithm
takes each interaction, and transfers the label across it with a probability
equal to the probability of the interaction. It is therefore *not* generalizable
for non-probabilistic networks.

The other pitfall is that there is a need to do a *large* number of iterations
to get to a good partition. This method is also untested.

This function is a wrapper for the modularity code. The number of replicates is
the number of times the modularity optimization should be run.

Non-keywords arguments:

1. `A`, probability matrix

Keywords arguments:

1. `replicates`, defaults to `100`
1. `kmax`, defaults to twice the matrix size, number of propagations to do
2. `smax`, maximum number of steps without an increase in modularity before LP stops

**Keep in mind** that this approach has not been thoroughly tested. The
*measure* of modularity works, but the *optimization routine* is not
guaranteed to give robust/correct results.
