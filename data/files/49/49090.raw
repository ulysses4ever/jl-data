**Fractional trophic level**

    fractional_trophic_level(N::Union{UnipartiteNetwork, UnipartiteQuantiNetwork})

As defined by Pauly & Palomares.

This function takes a unipartite network, either deterministic or quantitative,
as its input. There is currently no trophic rank formulation for probabilistic
networks.

The primary producers have a rank of 1, and species consuming any species of
maximal level ``n`` have level ``n+1``.

Note that the trophic level is measured on the network with self-interactions
removed.

"""
**Trophic level**

    trophic_level(N::Union{UnipartiteNetwork, UnipartiteQuantiNetwork})

As defined by Pauly & Palomares.

This function weighs the fractional trophic level as returned by
`fractional_trophic_level` by the proportion of the prey in the predator's diet.
Specifically, this is done with:

``\text{TL}_i = 1 + \sum_{j \in \text{preys}}Â \left(\mathbf{f}_j\times\mathbf{D}_{ij}\right)``

The ``\mathbf{j}`` array has the fractional trophic levels, and ``\mathbf{D}``
is the matrix with diet proportions. ``\mathbf{D}_{ij}`` is ``0.0`` for all
non-consumed preys. In a quantitative network, it is
``\mathbf{A}_{ij}/\sum\mathbf{A}_{i\dot}``, and it is the same in deterministic
networks although it works out to ``1 / k_{o}(i)`` in the end.

As for `fractional_trophic_level`, this function is applied to the network
without self-edges.
