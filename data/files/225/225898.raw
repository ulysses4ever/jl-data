# According to file format specified in Matlab script
# written by Mykel Kochenderfer, mykel@stanford.edu
#
# This script converts a json file produced by RLES and converts it to a "waypoints" file
# of the following format.
#
#   WAYPOINTS FILE:
#   The waypoints file contains a set of encounters. Each encounter is
#   defined by a set of waypoints associated with a fixed number of
#   aircraft. The waypoints are positions in space according to a fixed,
#   global coordinate system. All distances are in feet. Time is specified
#   in seconds since the beginning of the encounter. The file is organized
#   as follows:
#
#   [Header]
#   uint32 (number of encounters)
#   uint32 (number of aircraft)
#       [Encounter 1]
#           [Initial positions]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               double (north position in feet)
#               double (east position in feet)
#               double (altitude in feet)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#               double (north position in feet)
#               double (east position in feet)
#               double (altitude in feet)
#           [Updates]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               uint16 (number of updates)
#                   [Update 1]
#                   double (time in seconds)
#                   double (north position in feet)
#                   double (east position in feet)
#                   double (altitude in feet)
#                   ...
#                   [Update m]
#                   double (time in seconds)
#                   double (north position in feet)
#                   double (east position in feet)
#                   double (altitude in feet)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#                   ...
#       ...
#       [Encounter k]
